    "# Analysing Amazon Reviews with Pandas Part I: Reading the data\n",
    "(2017-02-03 (C) Wouter van Atteveldt CC-BY-SA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the previous handout, we will analyse the Amazon reviews from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon. You can download any of the 5-core subsets for a product category, for example the Grocery and Gourmet data using the link found on canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is composed of review data and product (meta) data, and can be used to answer a lot of questions.\n",
    "For example, what product got the most reviews? What product got the best reviews? \n",
    "What was the most controversial product, i.e. the one with the most divergent reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this handout, we will be doing the analysis in pandas. In comparison with the previous exercises, this showcases how pandas can be used to easily manage and analyse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with a substantive analysis, we want to get the data and read it into pandas data frames and save them as pickle files.\n",
    "The next handout (Part II: Controversial reviews?) will do a substantive analysis of the reviews."

    "Since DataFrame accepts a list of dictionaries as input, we can directly use this to create the dataframe.\n",
