And the flavor is nutty and tastes very much like blueberries, moreso than most \"blueberry\" products. But that\\'s where the pleasurable parts end. The texture is like someone sat on your Great Aunt\\'s fruitcake on a long trip to Oshkosh and then gave you a slice. It seems compacted and gooey. Nothing you\\'d want more than one of. Ever.Solution to factory-made bars? I have been making my own for about 3 months now. I use whole wheat flour, wheat germ, whole oats, vanilla, bananas, dates, raisins, figs, dried cranberries, hazelnuts, coconut, honey, eggs and brown sugar. Sometimes I add bits of organic chocolate. That\\'s it. I bake them for about an hour and they are light, fluffy, chewy and fantastic. They only take about 10 minutes to mix up and cost about 2/3rds less than a box of granola bars and I get about 3 times more bars. And each one is practically a meal because I cut them large.Why can I do this so cheaply, quickly and easily, yet a food factory with a big budget can\\'t seem to make a decent granola bar? Overhead and corporate silliness, I guess.',\n",

Whereas the Wild Blueberry was heavily condensed with blueberries and one could truly feel the berries on one's tongue, one only has a hint of cherries in the Cherry Cahew bar. The dates are also less prominent in the Cherry Cashew when compared to the taste of dates in the Wild Blueberry bar.This bar is tasty, but I would endorse the purchase of the Wild Blueberry and would feel inclined to purchase Wild Blueberry and would only get the cherry Cashew for variety.\",\n",

The Cherry is much sweeter, and if you\\'re having a desperate \"sweet tooth fit\" will be the winner. Wild Blueberry is mighty fine too, but not as sweet and much blander. The Chocolate Brownie is less sweet than the Cherry/Cashew, with a very dark chocolately taste, and is totally yummy.With \"Nothing Cooked, Nothing Processed,\" and all its wonderful ingredients, PURE Bars are a truly great snack. So indulge!',\n",

Not only did it had the texture and taste of a bad fruitcake, but it was less nutritious than a comparative bar like something from Luna or Cliff. It also containing a whopping 14% of your daily fat intake. The only real value of the bar is in terms of copper and dietary fiber, both of which you can get in many other things and with far less fat. Perhaps a Fiber One bar which has less calories than this and 45% of your fiber instead of 16%All in all, I love that Pure bars are mostly organic, but they have no flavour or any actual health benefits. It\\'s kind of a sham meant to prey on people that just see the word \"organic\" and assume something is actually good for them. Stay away.',\n",

It is not so strong that it taste\\'s fake, but you know you\\'re eating a blueberry fruit bar.If you like something with a little lest tang and just a little less chewy feel, try Pure\\'s Wild Blueberry bar.For those of you who like a bar with a light feel, this is not the one for you.

My normal breakfast routine consists of green tea and a Luna bar, so I was interested in comparing and possibly having a different alternative.The ingredients are good: it\\'s certified organic, gluten-free, has protein, Omega-3 added in, and it\\'s vegan. There is no gluten, dairy or soy for people who are allergic to those. Of course, there are cashews, which are frequently processed in plants with peanuts, so I\\'d recommend people with peanut allergies steer clear of this bar.It has slightly more calories (200) than a standard Luna bar, and 9 grams of fat. That seems a little excessive, even accounting for the cashews in the bar itself. There are 4 grams of fiber, which is decent. The other nutrients of measure in the bar itself are mostly minimal, which makes it hard to believe the claim that the bar contains a \"full serving of fruit\". It is low sodium, to boot.The flavor, as other reviewers have commented, was very much reminiscent of fruitcake - only a little more dry, and with nuts.

They have a wonderful, deep intense flavor, very much like the best blueberry cobbler. To be honest, I had very low expectations when I first got them. Most of the time \"natural\" means \"tasteless cardboard\". But that was definitely not the case with these.My only \"problem\" was that they have 12g of sugar--which is due to the blueberries. I usually try to keep below 9g. But after tasting them, I think I\\'m going to make an exception for these. They work out wonderfully well as a mid-morning snack for me, since I eat breakfast at 6am and then don\\'t have a chance to get to lunch until around 1pm. It makes for a long morning without something other than black coffee to tide you over. These bars really hit the spot for me.I don\\'t know if I just got a fresh batch, but one of the other things that pleasantly surprised me was that the bars are not dried out.

Nuts and blueberries are visible through a brown paste, which has a slight sheen to it.Taste and TextureThe best part - you taste the nuts (walnuts, almonds and cashews) almost immediately. Actually I thought there was oats in it, but it\\'s all in the nuts. Texture is somewhat pasty and fibrous, but thankfully not dry.Lots of fiber (3g) which according to the label may contain \\'pieces of nuts, shells, stems or pits\\'.  Not reassuring, but definitely organic!Certified organic, this bar has rice protein and agave nectar, with a few other this and that thrown in, but very little.  It\\'s considered \\'raw, vegan, rich in omega-3\\'s, a full serving of fruit, certified organic and gluten-free\\'. Taste however, at least for me, it lacks.Overall, I liked the idea of it, and will give the makers kudos for putting all kinds of good stuff in there, but if you need to find a quick snack that\\'s under 200 calories and is gluten-free, consider a handful of raw almonds and a piece of fruit instead.  It would taste much better and probably cost the same or less.',\n",

If you are a health nut who views food as mere sustenance and doesn't look to eat things that taste good then by all means, dig in.  Personally though, I take my food a little more seriously.  I love to eat healthy (or at least I want to love to eat healthy) but I also require that my food taste good.I don't just want to feel full, I want to feel satisfied.PURE organic bars are full of organic goodness, but they don't do anything for my taste buds.  I'll say too that the consistency of the bar itself is not really that appetizing.  I've had fruit bars before, and they are rather gummy in texture and that isn't really appealing to me, and this bar is similar in texture.  For a `Wild Blueberry' bar too, I didn't get very much blueberry flavor.It was kind of bland.There are certainly better tasting bars out there that are healthy for you.  They may not be organic and they may not have `nothing' in them, but they at least have some flavor.There is a long list of no's on the back; they should have added `no taste' to the list.\",\n",

HOWEVER, the bar is still very sweet because the first ingredient is dates, so there are 17 grams of sugar, but they're natural fruit sugars. due to dates' high glycemic index, this would not be recommended for diabetics, though if you're a diabetic, you shouldn't consume any of these energy bars.overall, assuming that it doesn't deviate from how energy bars are supposed to be, it's delicious. and i like that there's a raw, organic alternative, so it's also not very processed at all. my toddler and i ate this thing up after the free sample from amazon arrived - i realize why the vine program can increase revenue because i'm gonna have to buy more of these on my own... thanks for suckering me in.\",\n",

Even on those days, I can still eat at my desk while working.  Be that as it may, the energy bar thing has never really made sense to me, nor had I found any that tasted decent.Pure, however, has made a couple that actually taste like food, instead or sugary chemicals.  The Cherry Cashew flavored bar, specifically, actually tastes like cherries and cashews (imagine that!).  I was surprised by the flavors, namely the actual ones listed on the label, along with the near complete lack of artificial or chemical flavors.  As for the texture, it's not dissimilar from other like products; it's a cross between a brownie and a caramel bar, chewy, but firm.  Overall, a darn fine product.I'm not about to start eating power/energy bars every day now in place of meals or just whenever, but I will say that if I had to choose one, this would be it.

There's a lot of goodness packed into the 1.7 ounce bar.  Of course, it weighs in at 190 calories, 70 of which are from fat, and 26 carbs, but you also get 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, not to mention the goodness that you'd get from a serving of raw fruit and raw nuts (which can be a little bit inconvenient to carry around in your bag when you're out and about.)  The Pure Bar is going to keep you feeling fuller longer than if you were to grab up a candy bar, plus, with the Pure Bar, you're not getting all that refined sugar, trans-fat, saturated fat, and guilt that is served up in a candy bar wrapper.Pure Bar is sweet enough to chase off a craving for sugar.  In fact, for something that's made of raw fruit and raw nuts, it's quite sweet, bordering a little bit on that kind of sweet that gets you in the back of the throat if you're not careful.  But taking smaller bites and chewing thoroughly helps with this, as opposed to biting off a quarter of the bar at once. The fruit flavor is very intense, and so are the flavors of each individual nut.  That really impressed me!  I could taste the walnuts and cashews, as opposed to seeing them in the bar and feeling them in my mouth, but otherwise having no taste experience of the nuts.  The bar itself has a good texture.  Not too wet, not too dry.My favorite use of Pure Bar would be on the go, when I couldn't take fruit or nuts with me, but knowing I could find myself away from the kitchen or anywhere with healthy snack options when hungry-time strikes.  It's a better choice than a candy bar, but me, personally, I wouldn't want to use this as an everyday stand-in for breakfast or lunch, simply because the Pure Bar still contains 190 calories, in a little bar-sized package that will be eaten up in under two minutes, even if one were to take smaller bites than the previously-mentioned quarter-of-the-bar-sized bites.  I'd think of it as emergency rations, or an occasional less-guilty treat than most other conveniently-packaged treats out there.\",\n",

It is completely organic, gluten-free, with a full serving of daily fruit!, added protein (nuts), 3 grams of fiber (comparable to two slices of wheat bread), completely raw (which keeps more nutrients than anything cooked) and vegan.Even though they call it a Wild Blueberry bar, blueberries are only the FIFTH largest ingredient -which I thought was interesting.  The main four ingredients are Dates, Cashews, Walnuts, and Rice Protein Concentrate(so maybe they should have called it the Date Cashew bar?)  Regardless, the blueberry taste is definitely there.Just like with the Cherry Cashew bar, the caloric content is 190 calories, with decent fiber, and 7 grams of protein.  It is definitely a healthy alternative to a standard chocolate bar; your body will thank you, and you\\'ll feel better for it.As for taste, it was pretty good.  It was smaller than I expected, and was very compressed -the consistency was kind of like a hybrid fudge/granola bar, without the chocolate taste...Four stars because it doesn\\'t fail in any of the areas it was advertising.  (I.e. It doesn\\'t taste as \"good\" as a chocolate bar, but you weren\\'t buying it for that, but for a healthy snack that fits the bill.  It does.)

While I don\\'t like cherry flavor, I do like fresh and dried natural cherries.  This bar did not disappoint. Tart, sour, lots of flavor...The cashews added a few little chunks to an otherwise \"soft\" bar... I think I would have preferred the texture if it picked either a soft, chewy, smooth consistency or a trail-mix chunky bar, as the little bits of cashew in the otherwise soft bar just were not appealing to me.Nutritionally, I liked the breakdown as I am a Type 1 Diabetic and I am always looking for a good snack to toss in my bag, just in case my sugar starts dropping.  Typically I either treat a low or prevent one by grabbing a meal... Having a bar with fair amounts of protein and fat AND dried fruit is perfect as the dried fruit affects my blood sugar much faster than the protein (but still not so fast, in this bar, that I would use this as a low blood sugar/hypoglycemia treatment), then the protein kicks in.  As a meal replacement, in a pinch, this is great.  I plan on buying more and stashing them in this year\\'s hurricane kit.',\n",

In addition to being Certified Organic, this bar is gluten-free and vegan. Furthermore, the Wild Blueberry flavor contains a full serving of fruit, is a good source of fiber (3 grams), and provides Omega-3s as well. There is also a decent amount of protein (6 grams, slightly less than the Cherry Cashew bar), and although the amount of sugar is higher than I would\\'ve liked (19 grams, or almost 4 teaspoons), the bar is naturally sweetened using agave nectar only, with no other added sugars added.The bar was thick and dense in appearance, with an almost slightly sticky feel. The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).  The bar also did have a nutty flavor, and in fact it contains cashews, walnuts, and almonds.  Overall, I liked the taste (I like dates!), but I thought the \"Wild Blueberry\" label was deceiving, and I definitely have had other bars that I prefer.In the end, I liked the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar a bit more than this one, and I would rate the nutritional profile of that flavor as slightly better as well. Although these bars are not perfect, I would definitely recommend them to someone with specific dietary needs, such as vegan or gluten-free.',\n",

I have had a few and found this bar to be much sweeter and tastier than the others, which mostly taste like cardboard with sugar on top. This was very chewy and had a lot of cherry flavors. It tasted fresh and was surprisingly filling for such a small bar. It is definitely an above-average bar. I feel like it is made of \"good stuff,\" but the calorie count is a bit high (200). That said, it will cure a sweets craving without nearly as much impact as a candy bar, plus it\\'s just better for you in all respects.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The first thing I noticed unwrapping the bar was how unappetizing it appeared, but how glamorous can an energy bar really get, right? Seriously though, try to get past the appearance.The texture is pretty typical for an energy bar - chewy, but not as tough as a PowerBar, for example. I don't believe PowerBar makes blueberry bars, so that's one reason to choose Pure. I've noticed comparisons to the filling of theFig Newton(a delicious cookie I might add!), and I'd agree that's accurate. The blueberry flavor is not that prominent, however. I wanted to taste more blueberries, but having more than one bar at a time isn't a healthy choice. Each bar contains 8 grams of fat and 19 grams of sugar.Overall a good balance of fruit, nuts, and texture, but be prepared for lackluster taste.*EDIT November 10, 2011*I'm actually beginning to enjoy these more. I can't have dairy products, which many energy bars usually contain, but the Pure bars are free of dairy, so I have to acknowledge it. I've been trying different flavors and bringing them while hiking or out and about, and they give me a boost when I really need a snack. I appreciate these much more than I once did.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I honestly enjoyed eating this.  The texture was much heavier and denser than I was expecting.  That's not really a bad thing, I was just surprised.  It has some chunks of nuts in it (obviously this isn't good for people with nut allergies, but I think the 'fruit and nut bar' part of the name would have tipped those people off.  To me, the flavor is nicely sweet.  Most of what I eat isn't sweetened very heavily, so it may be that people who are more used to drinking soda and eating sweeter foods would find it under-sweetened.  For me it was just pleasant without being too sweet.I had it as a snack and I think it was just a little too heavy for that in my case.  I'm used to eating pretty light snacks.  I think the next time I have one of these, I'll have to treat it more as belonging in the 'meal replacement' bar category, rather than the 'snack bar' category.  For people used to heavier snacks, your mileage will definitely vary.I like this a lot for the fact that it tastes good, it travels well, and there's nothing in it that you need to feel too bad about eating.  There is a fair bit of fat, but anything that contains chunks of nuts is going to have some fat (and just speaking for myself, I'm prone to have days when I don't eat enough fat, so it's actually probably a good thing for me).  I would've ideally liked for it to have a little bit more fiber, but it's not too bad in that area.The flavor that I tried was the Wild Blueberry and I could definitely taste the blueberry flavor in it, though it wasn't overwhelming at all.  I like blueberries, but it's not usually my favorite flavor in this kind of thing (the company offered me a blueberry flavored bar as an item to try and review).  I'm rating this partly based on the fact that I'm a little lukewarm on blueberry flavored things in general, and I still really liked this.  I have a feeling that if I try out one of the flavors that are a little closer to my normal tastes, these could very easily become my 'go to' option for carrying around in case I find myself feeling like I need something to eat away from home.\",\n",

I found it tart and unnatural tasting, nothing like the cherry flavor that I was expecting (it didn't taste like real cherries, marachino cherries, or the fake cherry flavor that so many candies come in, it just tasted like a mixed berry type of bar with all the sweetness sucked out by the preserving process).  It was chewy and stuck in my teeth (not what I was expecting either).  And the nuts were mushy (probably because of the fruit).  I had given half to my daughter (4 years old) and started on the other half.  She liked it so I gave her the rest of mine after a few bites.  But even she was just okay with it, not wanting to throw it away but also not gobbling it down like she does with most granola bars and fruit bars.  I do not recommend this bar for taste at all.On the health side, it does have a lot of healthy ingredients (if you can overlook the few chemicals thrown in to preserve and improve taste).  And it wasn't high in calories like many bars are.  I wouldn't overlook this if you are the type of person who wants to eat healthy on the go and doesn't mind the taste (my father in law probably would have liked it, his food is often very bland and unappealing but he eats for health only).\",\n",

I'm mainly looking for something that tastes good, is nutritional, and is not too expensive.Visually, it's a small  dense bar. It's about 3  inches in length, less than  inch in height. I can see large chunks of nuts and there are a lot of blueberries in the bar. When you open the bar, you immediately smell blueberries. It's probably not the most attractive of snack bars, but to be honest, that's not important to me.Taste-wise, I liked it. It's sweet but there's no aftertaste. It's a bit chewy (which I would expect considering the ingredients) with the crunch of nuts. Overall I found it to be a very tasty bar which I can see eating for a mid-morning or afternoon snack.Nutritionally, this bar has 8g of fat, no trans fat, and  3g of fiber (12% DV), which is described as high fiber (in the Amazon description) but that doesn't seem all that high to me (the bar is more honest as describing it as a good source of fiber).Looking over the ingredients everything is listed as organic, with nothing cooked, or processed. Ingredients are listed in this order: Cashews, Walnuts, Rice Protein Concentrate, Wild Blueberries (with Apple Juice Concentrate and Sunflower Oil), Agave Nectar, Almonds, Lemon Juice Concentrate, and Blueberry Flavoring. For a blueberry bar, I wish that the blueberry ingredients were listed higher.Overall, I think these bars would appeal to someone who's interested in organic food or someone who's looking for a gluten-free, raw snack that's also tasty. Of course, organic unfortunately does mean more pricey. At more than $1.50 a bar, these are not inexpensive.\",\n",

Otherwise there are probably better nutritional alternatives you may prefer that have more protein.

This is definitely not a good snack for anyone with nut allergies, as it's studded with nuts.  If you're not allergic, it may make for a nice snack, if you are not bothered by the following.First off, the primary flavor of this bar comes from the ground dates.  While I could taste the blueberry in it, it was more something that would sneak up on me every few bites or so.  Mostly, it tasted like I was eating a ground date bar.  The nuts provide a nice crunchy contrast but, like the blueberries, I only encountered them every couple of bites.  If you're a big fan of dates, you would likely really enjoy this bar.  If you don't like dates, this is definitely not for you.The thing that really held me back from truly liking the bar, though, was the texture of it.  I liked the crunch of the nuts, but the bar has a very grainy texture, which is also a result of its being mostly dates.  With each bite I took, I liked the flavor and really wanted to like the bar, but I just couldn't get past the texture.  I like the concept of it, but I think it would have tasted better if it had fewer dates and more grains, giving it more of a granola bar texture.\",\n",

I mainly eat them at work when I can't easily make something because they are very easy to bring along and have when I'm hungry.  I like how these bars taste and I also like that all of the ingredients are not only organic, but also good for you.  The consistency is somewhat like a banana with nuts in it, so this is not a very hard bar, but the nuts to give it a little crunchiness which is nice.  There is also a decent amount of protein in fiber which I like to have in the bars I eat.  All-in-all this bar will likely stay in my rotation at least until I get tired of it or find something I like better.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'m not sure how one is supposed to approach food reviews, but this is rather simple. All of these \"organic/vegan/all natural\" bars all wind up tasting the same. The primary ingredient is always dates, because they\\'re the only filler material that apparently works. This isn\\'t to say that the bars are bad, though they start out okay and taste like their namesake, but eventually the blueberry taste vanishes into the void to be totally replaced by the flavor of dates and the occasional walnut. This isn\\'t a coke v pepsi issue either, preferring one to the other. This is a pepsi vs. pepsi vs. pepsi problem. The only ones that break the mold are those that cram in enough spices to leave you coughing dust.Basically, if you like dates and nuts and you want something small for an brief energy bump, these work. The challenge is finding the particular variety that you prefer, and best of luck in that endeavor.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I am pretty experienced with energy / breakfast bars. I bike to work and often pack an energy bar as a quick breakfast or midday snack, and also used to eat them for supplemental protein or as meal replacements... suffice it to say I've tried numerous flavors and varieties of Powerbar, Clif Bars, Balance, South Beach, Quaker Oats, Nutri-Grain, Luna, etc.I got this bar as a free sample (Cherry Cashew flavor) and have to say I'm pretty impressed. I normally don't worry too much about getting 'organic' or 'vegan' food... I love meat, and I love saving $, so I tend to choose cheaper 'normal' stuff over the vastly more expensive vegan / organic alternatives, and this extends to my energy bars. However, after trying this Pure Bar, I may actually consider buying some next time I'm at the store.First thing that struck me was how soft & moist the bar is. At room temperature, it's not dry like most breakfast bars, nor is it as chewy / hard as many energy bars. Instead, it had the texture and consistency of maybe a dense fruitcake? Flavor was nice. Not too strong, not any hint of that weird protein taste, not too sugary... pleasant (in my opinion). I ended up wolfing it down and then checked the nutrition info on the back.This bar isn't going to fill your daily fiber requirement, nor is it going to satisfy a bodybuilder's protein requirement, but I found the nutritional value to be very well balanced and healthful. Lots of vitamins, 12% of your fiber, low carbs (compared to many other energy / breakfast bars), a decent amount of protein (7g, again nothing crazy but also better than most sweetsy breakfast bars), low fat... plus, whether you're a vegan or not, you can't really knock it for being organic and made with all vegan ingredients.I really do believe I will begin buying this bar as an alternative to fruit when I need a quick breakfast or energy on the go. This is probably great for kids, too... as a snack or as a lunchbox stuffer. Only drawback is the $1.50 pricetag per bar, but that's not so bad considering the high prices for other similar organic / vegan energy bars. Aside from wishing the bars were a little cheaper, I definitely recommend them.\",\n",

This bar is loaded with nuts, specifically cashews, walnuts and almonds.  It is also produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, peanuts, fish, tree nuts and wheat.That said, it's a delicious and refreshing snack, and I say that as a certified, devout junk-food junkie.  Each bar has 190 calories (70 from fat) and a full serving of fruit for the day, as well as omega-3s and fiber.  It's organic, raw and vegan. And gluten-free, because the packaging notes that the PURE company is a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I wasn't sure how I'd like the taste, given all the foregoing, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's just sweet enough, the blueberries aren't overpowering, and it has a nice balance of chewiness and crunchiness.  It is expensive as snacks go, but all the money's right there in the munchie little bar.Yum!\",\n",

The Wild Blueberry bar taste reflects the ingredient order - much more of a date bar flavor than a blueberry bar flavor.I couldn't compare the Pure bar directly with Larabar or Soyjoy (what I had on hand) because I didn't have the same flavors in those brands - on hand- Soyjoy Strawberry Bar & Larabar Apple Bar.  Taste-wise, the apple & the strawberry bars tasted more like the real fruit, while the Pure blueberry did not; however, density & moisture seemed to be about equal in all bars (Soyjoy was a smaller bar at 1.06 oz)Nutrition:  This is a single serving bar that packs a calorie count of 190.  The protein count is 6g and total fat is 8g.  Fruit & Nut Bar-wise this bar ranks right in there with similar fruit & nut bars (Larabar & Soyjoy, although Pure seems to have a bit more protein).Overall Impression:  For my tastes, while the fruit & nut bars (Pure, Larabar, Soyjoy, etc.) are convenient & easy to carry around, I more apt to stick with real (unprocessed) fruit & nuts, especially given the caloric count in each bar and the fact that the flavor doesn't send me to the box wanting more.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I was certain I\\'d prefer the blueberry flavor when I got both blueberry and cherry of this Pure bar as I\\'m a far more of a blueberry fan than a cherry fan due to the typical acidity of cherry...but the cherry one was by far my favorite of the two. Very smooth cherry flavor. Although I\\'m also a big fan of the cashews...both for nutritional reasons and flavor, you won\\'t taste much cashew in the bar, per se, as they are finely ground.Did I like it a lot? Yes.  Did I crave more? Not really. But I tend to eat more veggies and protein than I ever do fruit as a personal preference so, that being said, I think they may very well be \"crave-able\" to fruit fans wanting a healthy boost.I workout every day and love a good energy-burst bar prior to doing so, but have found most powerbars are packed with refined sugar and artificial ingredients. That\\'s a boost that undoes all the good my workout does! So finding one that\\'s filled with good natural things is always a quest I am on. While some of the newer bars have \"natural\" ingredients, however, this one goes a step further by having those natural ingredients also be organic...so the chemicals used in growing fruits in some bars that may or may not be washed off prior to processing into a natural bar is not a concern here. That\\'s especially good for a healthy snack for kids, but is a preferance for myself as well.The bar is entirely \"raw\" organic foods...the best for your body, filled with antioxidants. It is high fiber and has 400 mg of omega 3s...very important and many would rather eat a treat than salmon. They are gluten free, dairy free, nongmo.The ingredient list is basic...no refined sugar, just organic cherries, nuts, dates...natural things.These are certified organic. Some foods that claim to be organic have been shown not to be...so this stamp is important meaning it\\'s regulated. They are low sodium.So why one less star? The small bar also has 200 calories. That may not matter to many, but I am short and also have a small build and 200 calories for a snack is actually too much for me if I don\\'t want to undo an entire workout. Eating this as an energy bar prior to a workout would, therefore, undo my whole workout. I wish they could lower the fruit sugars a tad...BUT, that sad...this bar kept me full for a LONG time!! Because of the high fiber and good whole foods, it lasts so it\\'s great to pack if you know you are gonna be on the go somewhere with little time to grab something healthy.',\n",

However, many of them have long ingredient lists or leave something to be desired in flavor.  These Pure bars address this completely.  Much like the Lara bars they have a short list of minimally processed ingredients.  If you're tried of bars with lots of additives or ingredients you cannot pronounce you will likely find this refreshing.  The taste is also pretty decent.  Granted, it's all a matter of personal preferences, but I find these okay to eat.  It's not something I would excitedly eat over dessert, but i's definitely palatable and reminds me of a blueberry muffin.  If you've tried the Lara bars I would say the flavor and consistency are very similar.  That said, they are definitely not as tasty or texturally appealing as the bars that have more ingredients (i.e. Odwalla or Luna).  Of course, it's all about making tradeoffs so if a long ingredient list doesn't bother you, you may prefer the other two brands.  However, if you're looking for somehting with a short ingredient list that is raw, vegan, gluten-free, or certified organic this is a good choice.The bottom line is this.  I personally think it's hard to make a bar with only a few ingredients that are all natural that tastes as good as the more processed bars, but overall this one does a pretty good job.\",\n",

At the same time, blueberries are not the dominant fruit.  Dates are the first ingredient and blueberries fifth.  I think of this as a date bar with blueberries added.  For such a small bar it has a lot of calories - 190, but I didn't detect a sugar rush.  Thus the energy in this bar is relatively slow burning, which is good.This type of fruit/nut bar seems superior to many granola bars that tend to be sticky to the teeth. It didn't take but a couple moments for me to eat this bar. That's 190 calories that were consumed rapidly. Therefore, this bar is not a substitute for fresh fruit and grains, although the packaging makes it convenient is ways that healthier foods cannot always compete.I think this is a healthy snack if one doesn't consume several at once, which is exactly what I would do because it didn't take but a moment for me to finish one.  I liked the taste of this dense, small bar.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My kids are chronic cereal/fruit/nut bar consumers. They eat them for breakfast, snacks, lunch and, if I would allow, dinner. We are always on the look out for new products that are delicious, but also healthy. So, the Pure Bar definitely appealed to us. When our sample bar arrived, I cut each of my kids (hereafter \"the bar nuts\") a slice. I deliberately separated them to ascertain their opinions.First up - the picky bar nut - my elementary school aged child: she was highly skeptical of the bar based on appearance. It is kind of a muddy colored mush. She took a small bite, chewed while pulling a face and said, \"I don\\'t like this, do I have to eat any more?\" I asked her what she didn\\'t like about the bar and it was basically everything from flavor to texture to appearance.Second-at-bat - the laid back bar nut - my middle school/cool child. He didn\\'t mind the appearance of the bar, in fact I am not sure he took note of it at all. He put the entire piece of bar in his mouth, chewed it slowly and said, \"yeah, these are good.\" Upon intensive grilling he admitted to liking the texture of the bar and the sweetness but noted that the nuts did not add flavor. (Whew - what is it with this age boy? It is like pulling teeth to get anything non-gaming system related out of them.)Third in line - the bar nut connoisseur - my young high schooler is the biggest bar consumer. He can empty a box in an afternoon. He was probably the most excited about the bar tasting and eagerly agreed to give his expert opinion. I gave him a jumbo slice of the bar and sat back to await the verdict. First he cleansed his palate with water, next he sniffed the bar, then he took a good sized bite, he slowly chewed the bar and a look of . . . total revulsion crossed his face. He swallowed and announced, \"personally, I think it rather horrible.\"Last at bat - the fashionable bar nut - my eldest child likes her bars fruit filled and healthy. She definitely liked the fact that the bars were organic and filled with raw fruit and nuts. She said that the packaging and bar appearance made her think they would be good for you. She liked the fruity sweetness of the bars and found the texture to be much like those of the multigrain cereal bars but a bit denser. When told that the tasting event was over, she promptly snatched up the remaining bits of the bar and gobbled them down.All in all I would say that these bars are a matter of taste. If you like really sweet, dense nut bars you will probably like these. If you are more of a grainy, crunchy bar lover, you probably won\\'t. A side note: the bars contain 190 calories and 8g of fat.',\n",

So, I took a bite and well, it tastes like your Aunt's old fruitcake recipe, except chewier.  I'm sorry, but no matter how much I want to snack on healthier foods and buy organic, I can't recommend this one.  I got a bit of a nutty taste, but couldn't quite taste the cherry either, but maybe it was because I couldn't get past the fruitcake'y' kind of flavor.So, though you could buy many bars that taste worst, I will not be purchasing this one. It just didn't have the appealing look or flavor to make me buy it.  Too bad-looks like there are lots of reasons why, if it tasted good that this would be the one to buy, but once again I vote flavor over just good for you, so I'd have to give this one a pass.\",\n",

One thing that I have noticed is that packaged foods are not something I enjoy anymore.  They taste dead and lackluster.Such is NOT the case with Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.  WOW.  This bar is fantastic.  As a raw foodist, I am used to foods sweetened with fruits and dates, so I taste a good solid cherry flavor.  People not used to raw food style might taste more date as well.The texture is perfect- just enough richness with a little crunch from the nuts.  The balance of flavors is wonderful and the over all effect of the bar is fantastic.  I will definitely purchase these in the future- they would be great to take on trips or when I can not whip up a raw food meal in emergencies.  Just have to make sure to drink plenty of water with this as with all dehydrated foods.I am thrilled to have the opportunity to taste this bar.  And for whatever it is worth, the blueberry version of this bar is less rich than the cherry.  The cherry bar is perfect when you are in the mood for a decadent dessert but don't want to compromise raw eating.  I can not rave about this highly enough.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I ordered this because I've had (and still have) type 2 diabetes for over 20 years now.  I keep it under VERY tight control, my A1Cs have been normal (high normal, but normal) all that time, so any new product that can delight my taste buds containing relatively little sugar (or better yet, none), is something I'm willing to try.  I also love cherries and cashews, so I figured this was a no-brainer.When I opened the Pure bar, it was as if the bar was compressed together, and upon tasting it, I tasted dates and cherries almost exclusively, both of which I like. The consistency was good, and the bar was chewy, which I also liked, but not as crunchy from the cashews as I would have liked.  Where WERE these cashews, anyway?  I looked at the label, and noticed the order of ingredients, and the first three are dates, cashews and cherries, all organic. I think they pulverized the cashews too much as well as the walnuts and almonds in the bar, as they all lent a sort of nutty rather than crunchy consistency to the bar, and the flavor of each (especially the cashews), was indistinguishable from the others.  Since I love cashews, and it was listed as the second ingredient, I was disappointed I couldn't tell them apart flavor-wise.  Maybe if they didn't crush them so much, the flavor of the cashews would be as distinct as the flavors of the dates and cherries, which would elevate the taste of the bar from good to great.  The bar would also have been more crunchy, something that's satisfying to me in any fruit and nut bar, organic or not.I looked at the nutritional value and saw that there was 25 grams of carbs, 17 grams of sugar (from organic agave nectar), and 8 grams of fat in a 190 calorie 1.7 oz bar.  While the Pure bar tasted good and kudos for its ingredients being all organic, it fell short of my expectations, and I was thinking I could have an entire 16 oz. can of fruit (pineapple chunks or peach halves in their own juice), for about the same values (including calories), as this 1.7 oz. bar.For diabetic purposes, I WOULD carry one or two of these around if I knew I wasn't going to be home all day and missing a few meals.  They DO taste good, take up very little space, and I'm sure they would keep my energy and sugar levels up until I got home.  I also like the fact that they're completely organic.  But for a regular snack at home, I would rather have a natural fruit cup, piece of fruit or something with a lot less carbs and fat strictly on an ounce-for-ounce basis.\",\n",

I don't eat this type of thing every day, so they wouldn't necessarily last the month-ish for me.  Despite not containing refined sugar, they still contain a high level of fruit sugars and they contain a very high level of things that many people are sensitive or allergic to and most importantly, are made in a facility that makes things that a very, very large number of people are dangerously allergic to, including wheat, peanuts and tree nuts.Positives: despite the pretty heavy taste of dates (for sweetness), there's a good blueberry and walnut taste as well and while it's borderline too sweet and at 190 calories, not exactly low calorie, it still comes out ahead of the other organic bars I've tasted (Think Organic and Raw Revolution).  In this particular bar, there are ten ingredients, all of which I actually can pronounce and know what they are, which is a good thing.Neutral: the texture was very uneven.  My first bite was smooth, the next bite had all sorts of nuts in it, the next bite had definite dates in it, the next bite had a tiny nut bit in it and otherwise was smooth.

The cherry taste came through a little, but the cashews were mostly wasted they may as well used a less expensive filler.Bottom line is I did like the bar, but it could be either made cheaper for what it is and still taste the same, or made better and maybe more expensive with more nuts, and more cherries.

If you are familiar with products likeRaw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Chocolate & Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)then this has a very similar consistency.  I would categorize it as something a more like the density of a brownie and less like a granola style bar, but definitely not as chewy as power bar.

These bars are vegan friendly, certified organic, raw, gluten free, and dairy free.  Somehow this bar packs quite a bit of taste into such a healthy sounding bar.  I really enjoy the natural flavor in this bar, which actually taste like blueberries, not the superficial candy blueberry flavoring that most processed foods have.  I like to eat one of these about an half hour before working out and then as a mid-day snack too.  Seems like the density of the nutrition really seems to stick with me longer than just a generic snack.

       "  'reviewText': 'I am a gluten-free vegan.  Not that I\\'m a health fanatic--I eat french fries, they\\'re GF vegan-- I just have certain dietary restrictions due to health issues.  So of all people in the world, I felt like celebrating when I found this bar.  I chose to try the blueberry flavor because I love love love real blueberries but have always detested artificial blueberry flavor, so I always taste challenge any product that claims to have blueberries in it.So what did I think of it?  Well, I have tried to think of a nice, mature way to state my first impression, but I can\\'t.  It looks like poop.  It is brown, pureed, and has nuts and berry chunks in it.  Then I tasted it.  Not bad.  No artificial blueberry flavor, not overly sweet, but a natural sort of sweet.  Good.  I offered a bite to my 4-year-old, but she clamped her mouth and went wide-eyed and ran away without tasting.  I offered a bite to my husband and he liked it and wants to buy more... he will really eat anything, so that says nothing.  My 9-year-old son liked it... he is a PETA fan, quite a hippie, so there\\'s some background for you.  My 7-year-old daughter was not overly thrilled but would willingly eat it if she were hungry.  As for me, if I had to choose between these bars versus trail mix, I would take whatever is less expensive.  It really seemed to me to be trail mix in a different form... various nuts, rice protein, blueberries.If you are really into health, and feel the need for bars, this is the bar for you.  If you, like me, are willing to be healthy but still believe in a dash of sugar or salt or oil or something slightly evil, then you will give this bar four stars... it is good, but not a flavor fantasy.I\\'m curious about the last ingredient: \"organic blueberry flavor.\"  How is that different from \"organic wild blueberries\" which are listed higher up?  Or if it is just flavoring, who decided that it tastes more like an organic blueberry rather than a standard blueberry?  Or can processed flavoring itself be considered organic?  There are some of these nutritional nuances I will never figure out.',\n",

It almost makes me think of a fruit leather with nuts in it, which, based on the ingredients, is pretty much what it is. It was very simple and natural tasting, sweet without being cloying, chewy, crunchy, and satisfying.I don't typically eat food bars (I'm more one for actual food), but if I needed some for travel or convenience, I would definitely choose these over any others I've eaten. Nice and moist, without that pulped cardboard texture most health-food meal/snack bars have. And this one is made entirely of recognizable food (Organic Dates, Organic Cherries, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Almonds, Organic Cashews, Organic Brown Rice Protein), not weird food-like components and derivatives (the exception being the brown rice protein, whatever that is).While they cost more than I'd be willing to pay for everyday use (as I said, I'm not really one for eating bars instead of food, so that sort of thing always seems like a bit of a ripoff to me), they're certainly on par in cost and size with other bars of their type, and for my money, much better, more natural and tastier.\",\n",

However the content is great, and I appreciate that.  This bar is vegan, good for Celiac Disease sufferers as it is gluten-free.  I would compare it a bit to the Pro Bar Fruition bar.  This bar has a higher protein count, which is always good in my opinion.  This bar has 6 grams of protein versus the 3 grams in the Pro Bar.  Both bars are the same size  The calorie count for the Pure Bar is a little higher (190 calories vs. 160 calories) but the real difference is the calories from fat.  With the Pure Bar 70 calories are from fat, vs. only 20 being from fat with the Pro Bar.  But don\\'t forget that the Pure Bar has twice as much protein than the Pro Bar.It has lots of great organic ingredients, and the wrapper states that \"nothing is cooked or processed\", which doesn\\'t really matter too much to me, but must be important to some.To me it comes down to texture and flavor, plus the protein count.  I wouldn\\'t eat this on a regular basis, but would come in handy for a mid-day snack when I\\'m out and about.  Since this bar has no chocolate type coating, it would hold up well in the heat.  Also since it\\'s gooey-ish, it wouldn\\'t get pulverized in my purse when carrying it around and forgetting about it.  (right?!)',\n",

I'm personally doing Weight Watchers diet program and I'm always on the lookout for low point, high satisfaction snacks. This one fits the bill.MY only contention is this. This is not a light snack by any means. Its pretty heavy. That's cool if you need an afternoon pick-me-up or an early morning breakfast grab, but just know that it fills.\",\n",

To my surprise I found the taste of cashew was very faint as walnuts and almonds were the more prominent nutty flavors.  That can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how much cashew you wanted in your bar.  What does explode is an incredible amount of sweet cherry flavor along with the fibrous texture common in health bars.  It has enough sugar (via agave syrup and already sweet Oregon cherries) to equal a couple of chocolate chip cookies, frankly, but if you'd rather get your sweets from nature it's a tasty choice.\",\n",

There is a very definite blueberry flavor which is both sweet & tangy. The downside is that it is very small and that I needed to eat 2-3 of these to achieve the same sustenance that is equal to a Kellogg's protein bar or Luna bar. If you want flavor and are willing to pay for it then you might not be put off by the fact that you need to eat several to feel full.I work in construction, a lot of time I get too busy to stop and eat a proper lunch and I live on protein bars to get me through the afternoon. So far my favs are the Power-bar Harvest bars and the Peppermint stick Luna bar for sustenance and flavor. It would be really neat if the Pure bar was bigger and could offer the same feeling of fullness and energy because these would blow the Cliff bars right off the planet.(sawdust, anyone?)I loved the flavor, I just wish there was more of it so I didn't have to eat so many as protein bars are not cheap it's good to get as much as you can from them, unfortunately only one Pure bar left me hungry less than an hour later.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'m always looking for a way to quickly eat a healthful midday snack. The problem is that Butterfinger and 3 Musketeers bars taste good but have no redeeming value whatsoever, and alternative snack bars that provide reasonable nutritional return generally taste like cardboard - or at least as how I imagine cardboard would taste were I to try it.So here we have a Pure Organic Wild Blueberry \"raw fruit & nut bar.\" Sounds good. I like raw fruit and I like nuts, so I\\'m inspired by the wrapper. The wrapper also has a sketch of \"Veronica,\" the creator of the PURE bar. I know nothing about Veronica but she appears trustworthy. She doesn\\'t look like she just chewed on cardboard. The nutritional information indicates that there is 6g of protein here among 190 total calories. There\\'s a small amount of multiple nutrients, but nothing stands out in terms of this being a significant source for anything critical. On the other hand, there\\'s nothing bad here. So this bar looks, from the numbers, to be a reasonable snack.My bar says, \"Best by 14 MAR 11.\" That seems very specific given the time until then. On March 13, 2011, it will be fine, but on March 15, all bets are off. But I\\'m assuming that 14 MAR 11 means March 14, 2011 and maybe it means something else.On opening, the bar has a pleasant aroma. It looks like a fig newton turned inside out. The consistency is similar to the inside of a fig newton without being quite as gooey. It\\'s pleasantly moist, without the uncomfortably dry texture so familiar from similar products. The bar contains nuts. I was pleased to see that I could identify the contents by taste; I looked at the ingredient list only after tasting the bar. There are no artificial additives here, and even the natural flavorings don\\'t overpower the bar. There wasn\\'t too much sweetening either so the bar tastes good without being sickeningly sweet.On the downside, my bar is labeled \"Wild Blueberry.\" I didn\\'t taste very much in the way of blueberry. Dates, yes. Blueberry, not so much. Calling the bar \"Wild Date\" would be more accurate, though perhaps not as easy to market. Wild blueberries, if you\\'ve never spent part of your summer picking them in the woods, don\\'t have a great deal of taste. As kids, we used to take a big pile of them and eat them all at once because if you ate them one-at-a-time, it was like eating nothing.So overall, a fine snack product. I\\'d change the name to something more suitable, perhaps less blueberry oriented, but I\\'d leave the actual snack bar alone -- it\\'s just right. Getting a bunch of these to store in the car glove box would not be a bad idea at all.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Pure's line of snack bars are tasty and somewhat nutritious, but I have a few hesitations from recommending them wholeheartedly:* Though I understand the benefits of eating raw foods, I have to question the advisability of manufacturing raw products for mass consumption.  There are so many points along the process where contaminants could be introduced, and in a product that is never heat treated, harmful bacteria could multiply unchecked and cause serious food poisoning (as seen in an unpasteurized, mass-produced line of apple juice a few years ago).  Organic products are not safe from this.  If Pure is taking any kind of measures to ensure the safety of its uncooked products, they haven't mentioned it.*  For 200 calories per bar, I'd really like a more substantial snack than the six grams of protein these bars offer.*  The texture is a little grittier than I like.My reservations about food poisoning will prevent me from buying these.  Otherwise, I likely would have bought them occasionally as a semi-healthy snack.\",\n",

Not so with others where I didn't care for it from the first bite.Plenty of blueberry flavor and crunchy nuts with no bad aftertaste. The texture takes some getting used too but I think part of that is knowing what to expect. Kinda like taking a sip of tea when you expect coke. I don't eat organic food but I could appreciate the experience of feeling pretty close to nature with this bar. Sounds corny huh.Anyway, as an alternative to a candy bar it is excellent. Better in every way and not even super expensive compared to candy prices. I like the serving and a half of fruit you get too.Darin\",\n",

It should be called \"Pure Bar Organic Wild DATE\" because it tastes and has a texture like dried dates (which is fine, I like dried dates) with a hint of blueberry.  It does smell blueberry-ish though.  The first few bites were really good and I kept thinking that it reminded me of eating a fruit roll up... but maybe having 70 of them smashed together and eating it in one bite... a kids dream.  I didn\\'t like the nuts in the bar.  I probably would have preferred it if it was a fruit only bar, for some reason the nuts threw me off and I got about half way through and lost interest.  My husband had a few bites and also had a similar reaction.Not sure how much energy I\\'d derive from it compared to other food bars, but even as a processed packaged food, it tastes light years better than most of the other bars I\\'ve tried.',\n",

The texture is a little odd: It's not dry and it doesn't have that cardboard characteristic a lot of organic foods have, but it is kind of sticky and gooey.  The sweetness from the fruit sugars in the bar is overpowering and a little cloying.  You can't even really taste the blueberry over all the other ingredients.  For an organic bar, though, it's quite good.  At 190 calories it's not quite a meal, so pairing it with something less sweet to make it a meal would be ideal.

       "  'reviewText': 'As you might be able to see I\\'m a Vine Voice member which means I get to sample products and then review them. I mention that not to brag but because Pure Bar was rather miserly with their sample size and I received a whopping one bar. With a product like this it can be difficult to make an accurate judgment, particularly on taste with just a single bar but I will try to do just that.It certainly wasn\\'t love at first bite. The \"Pure\" bar is rather dense and chewy with large chunks of nuts, dates and blue berries. My initial reaction was to compare it to a fruit cake and I am not a fan of fruit cakes. After a few more bites it started to grow on me but then it was done. In the end I would give the taste a good score. It\\'s not as tasty as a candy bar but it\\'s not advertised as a desert, it falls under the category of cereal bar. As a breakfast replacement it\\'s good for people on the go and I could definitely see it useful for travel and sports for a quick burst of energy.Where Pure Bar excels is in the ingredients and I\\'m willing to accept a less than staggeringly awesome taste given the fact that there are precisely zero chemicals and preservatives. Well, actually I\\'m not sure what Rice Protein Concentrate is but the rest is just dates, cashews, blue berries, walnuts, agave nectar and almonds. As the back of the bar says \"that\\'s all! Nothing cooked. Nothing processed. Completely PURE.\".Nearly $1.70 per bar is a little high but not killer. You can get a bit of mileage out of 190 calories and I figure there is an extra overhead to getting all organic ingredients with no preservatives. This price is marked down from $2.50 a bar and at that price I would take a pass. You could buy a decent meal of fruit from the grocery store for the price. I\\'ll give the makers credit for having their hearts in the right place and I think it\\'s a good product but it didn\\'t blow me away enough to get a full five stars.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"When I ordered this snack bar, I expected something likeNature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars, Fruit & Nut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12), something with lots of nuts and a little dried fruit. When I received the package and opened it, however, I found that it was the opposite: dried fruit with nuts mixed in. It looked like dark chocolate, only kind of waxy, not very appetizing. But looks aren't the most important part of a snack, so I bit in.And it wasn't very good. It had a tart, almost bitter taste. Tart is fine when there's another taste to complement it, but the only other flavor here was that cardboard-y, health-food taste. The consistency was pretty good, though-chewy, but not too chewy. And the bar does have a good shelf-life.The wrapper is pretty, but it's not bio-degradable, which I'm sure is important to a lot of organic food lovers.This snack is pretty good for you. All the materials are organic, nothing but dried fruit and nuts. It has a lot of antioxidants like omega3s. There are 17g of sugar, but it's all from the fruit, so it's better for you than products with added sugars. There're 8g of fat, .5g of saturated fat, and 190 calories. That's not bad, but I was hoping there would be some monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in it. The snack bar is gluten free, dairy free, and vegen, and that's good. You get 3g of fiber, but there's not a whole lot more nutritive value. You can exchange the bar for 1.5 fruits.And honestly, I would do just that. Fruit sure tastes better, and if you choose the right fruit, more nutritious. There really aren't a lot of nuts in this, and I was hoping for more (that's what she said). I think an organic trail mix would be a better choice. This snack isn't bad for you, but honestly, the best thing about that is that you can eat something else later without feeling guilty.\",\n",

According to the product page, it comes in a variety of other flavors, too, including wild blueberry, cranberry orange and chocolate.  It's low in calories but higher in fat than some health food bars I've had.  The taste of nuts and fruit was nicely meshed, and just one bar was enough to tide me over until dinner an hour later.  It reminded me of a Fruit Roll-up bar flavored oatmeal cookie.

It's made from organic ingredients:  dates, cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, wild blueberries, apple juice concentrate, sunflower oil, agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, blueberry flavor.  Nothing is cooked or processed.It's also gluten-free and vegan.  One bar equals a full serving of fruit. It has 190 calories, 70 from fat, but that good fat from the nuts.  The nuts also provide a lot of Omega 3s. It has 19g. of sugar - that's more or less a teaspoon of sugar, but not the processed kind because it comes from the fruit. I'm a diabetic and I would recommend this product.  I would have liked  a touch of salt.  It has 0% sodium but some would have rounded off the taste and taken the edge off the sweetness.  I would also like more of the blueberry taste to come through.\",\n",

The taste was OK as compared to other energy bars I have tried, and I don\\'t have any food allergies that I am aware of, so I would not personally choose these over and above other bars. The current price does not seem too outrageous, if the shipping is free so the value is fair, if you really need a bar that has ingredients like this one has. The label states 1.7 ounces, 190 calories with 8g fat and 7g protein (its all those nuts) so it compares to other energy bars but with lower overall numbers because it is smaller.I wish that I had more of these to try and see how consistent they are and if they really help when you are exerting yourself but I only received one. I wish that I had enough to share with my family and friends to see how they like them, but I only received one. I wish that I had one to keep in my bag for when I am hungry and need a snack, but I only received one.However, they are not in the business of passing out free samples and I wish them good luck in their endeavors. At the time of this writing, you might note that their bars that have a very few reviews have many stars and the ones with many reviews have fewer stars. So, you can tell the products that have had more use by a wider range of people. I am sure that this company would want you to read the fine print and purposely eat foods that make a difference to your body and the world. I probably would not have picked this bar in a store to try. I liked the Probar FruitionPROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry 1.7-Ounce, 12-count Boxbars better.Again, in my opinion, this single bar I tried is not really good or really bad (based on the single bar I tried), hence an average rating.

First of all, PURE meets all my dietary requirements for food bars: it must be organic; it must be raw; it must be vegan; it must be gluten free; it must not contain GMOs, preservatives, soy, refined sugar or trans fat; it must taste good.These chocolate brownie bars are the best! I agree 100% with reviewer Tennyson E. Stead who stated so well that these are the \"closest thing I\\'ve ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.\"  Really!

They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I\\'ve experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I\\'m happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season! Amazon\\'s Subscribe and Save Program is THE way to go too!  I am also signed up forPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)andPure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)which are also wonderful.  But hands down,Pure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)is my favorite and I love it best!',\n",

It looks like a rectangle of mashed dates with small white bits of macadamia nut. If you are into raw foods or on a vegan diet, it's a nice ready to go snack alternative.  The taste wasn't bad but it's not something that I would choose if I had another option.

The cherry flavoring has a bit less kick as it is not a sugary fruit snack, but it also tastes closer to the cherries in a cherry pie. I presume this is due to the cherries being thoroughly cooked before used in the production of this bar.The cashews are still crunchy, but the walnuts are really showing through. They are the dominant nut in this bar.These Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are quite dense. They remind me of protein bars and other bars made to stave off hunger. As dense as these little guys are, they should keep you going for a while before you need to eat. Excellent for those who might not have time to eat, but need something to help them get through the day.With the density, moistness and organic ingredients, these guys do not seem like they will last too long in your pantry. I wouldn't stock up on them, but rather order them periodically so you keep a fresh supply. Other than that, they taste great and are awfully good to eat!\",\n",

(If nothing else buy it to stand up to the Nut Police who want to eliminate all traces from their perfectly safe world - but I digress...)The bar\\'s texture is chewy but not sticky to the teeth. The cherry flavor is subtle at first bite, a black cherry that\\'s deeply aromatic once it kicks in. The cashew bits are more like slivers and somewhat lost in the mix. I would have preferred  more substantial pieces, halves or quarters to add cashew flavor and give a little more \"mouth feel\" as they say on those foodie programs.The description says \"Low Sodium\" and salt is not listed but I have to say part of my initial reaction was \"a bit salty\" - not sure where that came from, soy perhaps?Solid foil wrap that feels secure and a drawing of creator Veronica on the label, what more could you ask.

Reaching through the dark pangs of subtle hunger, I found the solid hope to fend off the deluge of Tex-Mex that awaited for me later in the day.The shiny package caught my eye like an oasis of city parks in an urban desert. I carefully opened it so as to not disturb the goodness that waited inside. The specimen of organic fruits, nuts and juices looked to be dense. Wariness gripped my heart as I thought of all the other energy and health bars I\\'ve battled with in the past. Oh, how I yearned for a fruit filled cereal bar in that moment if only to sway me from what I expected to be a bland and grainy experience.But then...a surprise.The bar, an elusive prize, was flavorful. Distinct fruits could be picked out. It was a thing to be enjoyed... no... savored at a slow pace. My bites were smaller than normal if only to imagine this very \"snack,\" to be a full blown meal. While there were similarities of look and texture to other similar \"fruit and nut\" bars, the experience allowed for a complete re-interpretation of how energy bar should be. To those other products, a metaphysical crisis loomed: what is it to be? To what end shall existence be perceived?I did not believe that the insanity of this alternate universe could grow further until I discovered, under the nutrition facts, that this delectable delight contained no sodium.I could only mutter \"what?\"',\n",

I could live with that if it tasted better, sadly it just does not. For that high a calorie content, sugar content and carb content, I could have a nice dark organic chocolate bar with no added sugar that would be much healthier. It was not the worst thing I ever ate but not all that good either. I would not recommend it, or buy it if I was looking for something of this nature. It sure looked good, unfortunately in the taste department it fails, and as far as healthy its not all that.\",\n",

It's hard to describe what the PURE bar (blueberry flavor) tastes like, but it's not an unpleasant flavor.  The fruity flavor is obvious, and the nuts do not overwhelm the tastebuds.  I like that the bar is soft and chewy, and not too sweet.  Also, it's made out of all natural and organic ingredients, with nothing processed.  That to me is worth having a bar that doesn't have the conventional taste of other energy bars.  The taste is not bad, but it's not delicious either.  However, the bar is filling and doesn't make you feel guilty about eating it, because the ingredients are so healthy.I would recommend these bars as snacks, but they do have plenty of calories, so I wouldn't eat too many of them at once.  But that's true of any kind of snack.\",\n",

It has almost a nothing flavor with a hint of 'berry' aftertaste but not much of anything during the eating.  Whether everything in it being 'raw' as opposed to cooked or 'processed' doesn't mean much to me or I would guess the average person.  This is really a product for the 'nutritionally conscience' of people who are concerned about everything they put into their body.  Even then I'm not sure that it is that much of any improvement over other 'organic' bars.One thing that did strike me was the claim that 'nothing cooked or processed'.  I just wonder as to the definition of the word processed.  You have to do something to put the bar together.  You don't just lay out the ingredients and they then crawl together on their own waiting to be cut into the right size.  Also, two of the ingredients are concentrated fruit juice.  Isn't concentration of juice a 'process'?  or do they just leave the juice out in the sun and let the water evaporate away naturally?  You decide, it's not really that important to me but I like to see truth in the production of things even if it just this little truth.Zeb Kantrowitz\",\n",

I can see where the ingredients might possibly cause such an effect in some, but doubt it would be an issue for most people.

These are moist and sweet, but it doesn\\'t overpower you. The blueberry flavor isn\\'t in your face, but you can tell it\\'s blueberry. Yes, the bar is ugly. But it\\'s ugly because it\\'s not full of artificial colors that make it look like something not found in nature.One thing I did enjoy more about Pure bars over Larabars is the texture.

When I was given the opportunty to try an organic bar that looked full of fruit and nuts, I leapt at the chance.This raw fruit and nut bar is labelled \"Charry Cashew\" and I think that is misleading.  I tasted very little cherry flavor and the cashews weren\\'t strong either.  What I did taste was dates and walnuts -- pretty different that I was expecting based upon the packaging.The bar itself is very dark (the color of dates) and the texture is very sticky (like a date) and very chewy (like dates) -- are you noticing a theme here?  While much better for you than many of the over processed, sugary granola bars, I was actually disappointed in the nutrients -- everything was in the 4% - 6% range for the required daily value.  Better than 0%, but not as good as I had hoped.Bottom line:  Not terrible, and I ate the entire bar without a problem, but not particulary good either.

       "  'reviewText': \"Surprisingly tasty without the sickeningly sweet taste of many other snack bars. I expected dry and tasteless but was pleasantly surprised to find it moist and flavorful.  Similar in taste to a Fruit or Fig Newton without the extra sugar, salt, nonessentials, and unhealthy ingredients. The all natural unrefined ingredients were a refreshing change from so many other over-processed bars that load up on sugar, salt, and chocolate to make them appealing. At the same time this bar is extremely filling without that spiked hungry feeling half an hour later that leaves you wanting more.  The most enjoyable thing about this bar is that you can taste the real blueberries. The dates, nuts, and other natural organic ingredients in this bar are noticeable but they don't seem to detract in any way from the blueberry flavor.Although high in calories (190 per bar), it has 0g of sodium, 3 g of fiber, 19g sugar 6g protein, making it a well within reason as a nutritious snack for someone who lives a healthy active lifestyle. I believe these bars would be great for anyone wishing to improve eating habits to include more natural and wholesome ingredients, or prefers organic foods to more processed and refined snacks, and perfect for Vegetarians and Vegans alike. But this bar might be a little too high in calories to be considered a weight-loss snack bar and possibly lacking in enough essential nutrients to be a full meal replacement.  Overall, I think it makes a healthy nutritious snack and is well worth the extra money it might cost over some of the competition, especially when considering it is organic and vegan friendly.\",\n",

So many bars of this nature (gluten-free, protein-powder-added type bars) has a distinctly \"vitamin-y\" smell and flavor. These do not. The cherry could certainly be more pronounced, but then I think that about every single fruit-containing bar I have ever eaten. So that may just be my sweet tooth acting up.Pretty good nutritionally speaking...super low sodium, good healthy nut fats, fruit, etc. Good amount of dietary fiber. Slightly high in sugar, but not terribly so.The other thing I liked was the texture. Chewy and moist, not gritty and chalky like you may expect. It would be great as solid food for a long bicycle ride.The only thing that puts me off at all is the expense. A little higher than I\\'m comfortable paying on a regular basis, but that\\'s all about how much value you place on the product and how much extra cash you happen to have, so YMMV.',\n",

From the product description, \"We specifically choose apple juice-infused (not sugar-infused) wild blueberries to avoid refined sugars\", which is a shame because blueberries are naturally sweet. The texture is similar to a Fig Newton, slightly chunkier, but still not appetizing for me.For the nitpickers out there, they also claim the product is gluten, soy and dairy free, but then state it is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish and tree nuts. Oh well, I suppose in our \"economies of scale\" world maybe it\\'s impossible to produce items without having them contaminated by unrelated ingredients and the hyper-sensitive part of our society dictates these have to be called out.

I take a bite and the first thing I notice is the nutty flavor, with a hint of blueberry aftertaste.  The bar itself is soft and ever so slightly sticky, but not sticky enough to be messy.  This bar is very densely packed material.  Not crumbly or flakey.I appreciate the fact that this is all organic and very healthy and that nothing is cooked and processed.  But I wonder how they deal with e-coli and the like.  E-Coli is found on plants and in animals.  The bar clearly states that it isn't processed or cooked.  I know there have been E-Coli scares with raw juices and spinach and other produce so I do wonder how they try and prevent it in their product.The flavor has a weird sweetness to it.  Maybe that is the nature of unprocessed food!  I don't eat a lot of organic food and the only raw food I eat is plain fruits and veggies.  When I bake I tend to pile on the sugar or honey in some cases for sweetness, so that is the flavor I am accustomed to.So for me this bar is not a good match, if I were to buy a fruit bar (which I don't do often) I'd probably stick to good ol' Nutragrain which has a flavor somehow more familiar.  But I think for someone is are ultra careful about what they ingest or for someone who only eats raw food this would be an ideal choice.  Actually, if I were part of the raw food movement, I'd tout this bar as a fast convenient snack.\",\n",

I enjoyed the flavor of this bar; the dates and cherries make a fine combination.It\\'s not sweet compared to a candy bar, but there is enough natural sugar in it from the dates, cherries, and agave nectar to total 17 grams of sugar in a bar.  There is also 8 grams of fat from the ground cashews, walnuts, and almonds.

Sometimes, I don\\'t climb into bed for another six hours.  At that late hour, I am normally hungry again.  Instead of eating junk food, I try to eat something healthy such as a bowl of high fiber cereal with nuts, a cup of yogurt, a bowl of grits or a small can of fruit.  I\\'m always looking for healthy alternatives for snacking.  However, some health bars taste horrible.  I was very excited to try the 1.7 ounce cherry cashew organic bar from PURE.All the ingredients are organic.  There are no preservatives or refined sugars.  This small, sticky bar is approximately 3 1/4\" long X 1 5/8\" wide X 7/16\" thick.  It has 190 calories, 70 of which come from fat.  I have scanned and posted the wrapper which shows the nutrition facts, allergy statement, ingredients, expiration date, web site and healthy reasons for purchasing the bar.Tonight, before going to bed, I ate the cherry cashew organic bar with a glass of cold soy milk.  Its bountiful supply of dried fruit (cherries and dates) and nuts (cashews, walnuts and almonds) gives it a chewy texture.  It has a deliciously tart cherry taste.  In this bar, I could definitely taste the cherries.  The wild blueberry bar from PURE had a more mild taste; I couldn\\'t really taste the blueberries.  These bars remind me of fruit cakes, the type I eat at Christmas.  When going to bed, instead of a plate of cookies, eat one or two of these PURE bars with a glass of soy milk.  I say two because it will be difficult to only eat just one.Joseph B. Hoyos',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"FLAVOR:While eating the bar, I could definitely taste the cherries.  While I could feel the bits of cashew, I didn't taste them until after...there's definitely a lingering flavor of cashew after you're done.  The cherries were delicious, and they really tasted like cherries, not like cherry flavoring.  Every bite tasted like a cherry, though it was balanced with a neutral flavor that kept it from being overwhelming.TEXTURE:The outside of the bar is sticky.  The bar itself, as you bite into it, feels firm and chewy.  There are nut bits distributed throughout which give a little bit of extra firmness.SIZE:The bar itself is around 3 inches long and around an inch wide.  It's a little more than a quarter of an inch thick.SATISFACTION:I used this bar as a breakfast bar, and it kept me feeling reasonably satisfied for ~4 hours, which is about all I ask of a breakfast bar.NUTRITION:I'm no expert in this area, but I do like that this bar has no refined sugar and has a good amount of protein.  I've been trying to find tasty bars that have protein for the morning, and this is one of the first I've found.  I also appreciate that it's only 190 calories, versus the 220+ that many other bars give.OVERALL:Overall, I'm going to be buying a few packs of these in different flavors as soon as I finish this review.  I'm really glad I got the opportunity to try it, and I definitely recommend it if you like fruity and chewy bars and are looking for a high protein breakfast alternative.\",\n",

I caught a little cherry flavor then cashew at first but it disappeared quickly and the next bit didn't help either. Sorry, but this is not very appetizing to my palette. I choose my caloric intake carefully and this just doesn't come up to a positive for me.  Maybe another combination might do it!I would suggest a little more cherry flavor and that possibly through adding additional sweetner to the mix.

It was very chewy and the individual flavors were strong and not too sweet - which was a good thing.  They didn\\'t skimp on the cherries or cashews, and the bar was a decent size too.  However, as odd as it sounds, I didn\\'t care for it because it tasted, well, raw.  I don\\'t feel the flavors blended well - it tasted like I had eaten a handful of the various ingredients together (like trail mix) with flavorless gum holding them together.  For those who care about appearances, the bar may not look appetizing.  It is very dark, almost black.Overall, I think (like many \"organic\" foods) that it is way overpriced for what you get.  At nearly $2 a bar with the Amazon discount, it is pricey.  There are other reasonably healthy alternatives for those just looking for a snack.  For those looking for an alternative energy bar - it\\'ll come down to taste and nutrition.',\n",

However, the Pure Bar was much more tasty than I expected.Weighing in at 190 calories, I would not classify this bar as diet food.  What I did find interesting about the Pure Bar is that it is not cooked or processed according to the wrapper.  The bar is slightly sticky, but definitely not messy.  The texture reminds me of an oatmeal bar, it is firm and chewy.  The bar definitely has a date flavor.  Personally, I found the tart cherries being the dominant flavor.Overall, the bar did have a subtly sweet, pleasing flavor.  At first bite, I thought the tartness of the cherries was quite excessive, but I quickly got used to it.One thing I did not like about this bar was the lack of crunch given the amount of nuts in it.  I expected more of a crunch to it, but the nuts seemed to be chopped up pretty well and there really is not a nice crunch to give a variety to the texture.Overall, I was quite pleased with this bar.  I think it would be an excellent choice for hiking or any endurance activity where carbs and protein would help provide long-term energy.  To be honest, while I still like my Snickers, I think this would be a decent tasting alternative that is much healthier and less calories.\",\n",

The current label has different ingredients and claims from the product description.

Too bad. Other things to be aware of: 19g of sugar, 3g fiber, 26g of carbs.Taste is, of course, such a subjective thing. I like this flavor. I can taste the blueberries and the dates. The texture rates \"so-so\" to me-- I prefer the texture of rice bars, granola bars, etc. better-- a crunchier and lighter texture. These bars are solid and smooth with just a little bit of nutty crunch.

The cherries were completely recognizable and had that tart/sweet taste of raw fruit, I could taste the dates, and pieces of nuts were plainly visible.  The bar was rather sticky which is probably to be expected of a raw, compressed food, but it wasn\\'t so much of a problem that it would cause me to refrain from buying this product.

Well, you just found it.  Costco doesn't carry these yet, but we liked them so much we put them on repeat delivery.  This bar is quite a bit sweeter than the coconut bar, but an excellent thing to bring on a hike or grab when you need something extra.  It could be improved by adding some vegetables to it, which would make it more expensive but more healthy as a meal supplement too.  Products like this could kickstart a huge business for Amazon because they solve a problem for people who are trying to eat healthy while maintaining an active life style.  Older kids will appreciate this bar, younger kids may find the flavor a bit &#34;different&#34; from what they are used to eating - totally adulterated food - but they will quickly get used to it!\",\n",

The 1.7 ounces are just too few for me to fully satisfy a sweet tooth.  The combination of nuts, fruits and goodies made a decently tasting bar.  It amazes me that they packed 170 calories into a 1.7 ounce bar but it's there.  I was lucky when getting ready to eat the bar in that I had a napkin handy.  If not, it would have been a stick mess especially had I planned to eat it on the go in the car.  I will pass on the significance of Organic.  I seldom purposely eat organic; however, it it there when available and for the most part organic is overpriced, tasteless products.  PURE is not tasteless.  It does leave a continuing and lingering aftertaste that lasts for about 4 to 5 hours.  After eating one bar I honestly could not say it will be added to the grocery list.  After eating several I might not like it as much as now and I may like them enough to consider buying more.  Right now, the jury is out or at the least taking a PURE break.\",\n",

Bring a couple to work--one for mid-morning and another for mid-afternoon--to keep that little nagging bit of wanting for something from distracting your brain.  It's great desk jockey food--perhaps even better than popcorn (other than plain).It's brain food, it's healthy, and despite all the claims of the innumerable 'nutrition' and 'healthy snack' foods competing for your attention out there the Pure Bar is one of the handful of items that actually is healthy and can be eaten guilt free.I'll even go so far as to say, it would be difficult to have fallen off the wagon by eating a few more of these in a day than you intended and have it really set you back in your weight management and loss goals.  Some foods, like the Pure Bar, are fine to pig out on once in a while.\",\n",

This makes sense, given that blueberries are rather low on the ingredients list, and nuts are at the top.

To me, the bar tastes more like dates than blueberries, but I\\'m not complaining at all about the taste, just wish they\\'d be more honest about the description.One thing I really liked about the bars is that they aren\\'t too sweet; just right. I don\\'t know why most companies think Americans will only eat things sugared to the point of being nearly flammable, but these guys get it. Unlike many other companies in this space, they didn\\'t load the bar with grape juice concentrate to boost the sweetness. I hope they are successful.

Since we deal with Celiac in our family, finding a gluten-free snack bar that has no added sugar is a plus -- most snack bars contain gluten and are loaded with sugar. Here, as with the Lara Bars, the sweetness comes from pureed dates and agave, a \"natural\" sweetener. The Wild Blueberry has a fresh taste that sets it apart from other raw bars. It also has a nice, chewy texture. We did a taste test and four out of five gave the bar a thumbs up. The one who didn\\'t like the bar also dislikes the Lara Bars and finds the taste a little off and too heavy for her.

Personally, I would like the bar to be a little bigger but, I often eat these bars either as a meal or while I am walking a round of golf so I want as many calories as I can get.

On the other hand, I don't always have time to make every item we eat.  So I'm very pleased to find a product as delicious and good for you as the Pure bars.  They are a bit pricy as you are paying for real fruit, real nuts...as opposed to the fakery in the cheaply delivered processed food industry.  I enjoyed all the flavors excepting banana coconut, which was too strong for me.  Highly recommend as a healthy on the go snack.\",\n",

I got one bite because the kids both wanted \"more more!\"This was very exciting to see as we have tried several bars that are gluten free and dairy free that have tasted less than stellar. This is made from all organic raw ingredients: dates, cashews, rice protein concentrate, wild blueberries (with apple juice concentrate and sunflower oil), agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, blueberry flavor.According to the package it is certified organic and certified gluten free. It also says it is raw, vegan, and free of soy and dairy. The nutritional breakdown is 190 calories, 8 g fat (0.5 saturated), 0 cholesterol, 0 sodium, 180 mg potassium, 26 g carb with 3 g fiber, and 6 g protein. One concern that was raised for me was that the package also stated \"This product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts.\" It does raise a potential for possible cross contamination.This is hands down the best snack bar I have ever tasted gluten free or otherwise. I will definitely be ordering some for my daughter to take to school for her snack.',\n",

Plus, he needs things he doesn't have to touch with his hands because he's usually got a lot of dirt on the job site and no access to a kitchen. These bars are a good choice for him because they are lower in calories than a candy bar but have a good amount of nutrition and fiber.The bar is made from dates, cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, blueberries with apple juice concentrate and sunflower oil, agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. It isn't cooked. The bar is 190 calories and contains 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 6 grams of protein. It also has a fair amount of potassium (180 mg), which is supposed to help balance sodium and help to keep blood pressure under control.The texture is dense but not heavy or gritty. It seems a bit less heavy than some other bars I've bought, and it has a good blueberry scent and flavor.

The ingredients are very natural with organic dates, cashews, cherries, walnuts, almonds, agave nectar and rice protein being the entirety of them. The cherries are a bit tart which helps give the bar a good flavor with enough sweetness added by the agave nectar. The bar is rather soft, but firm enough to hold.

Nothing cooked.  Nothing processed.  Is processed in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, nuts and fish.

Also has Vitamins C and B6, Calcium, Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folate, Phosphorus, magnesium, Zinc, and Copper.

The description sounded appealing and the flavor sounded like a good one which is why I decided to try it. I loved the fact it was organic, all natural, high in fiber and omega-3s. Unfortunately, I was completely unimpressed.The texture was the first thing I noticed about the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar that I did not like. It was grainy and a bit chalky, completely unappealing to me. I also did not like the fact they use apple juice as a sweetener for the bar, touting the fact this is all natural and not refined  sugar. However, apple juice is one of the highest sugar content fruit juices available on the market and is often used as a sweetener/filler in products because it is so cheap to produce, so this was not a positive selling point for me at all.Also, for this being sold as a blueberry bar, the blueberry flavor was not nearly as strong as I would expect from a \"blueberry bar.\" Personally, blueberries are one of my absolute favorite fruits and one I cannot get enough of when they are in season. So I had hoped this bar would have tasted better. The other ingredients, the nuts and the dates, overwhelmed the blueberries, not surprising when you look at the ingredient list and see that blueberries are not even one of the top 5 on the list.I can honestly say that I will not be adding the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar to my grocery list in the future and will continue seeking other alternatives instead.

       "  'reviewText': 'PURE organic wild blueberry raw fruit and nut bar looks a lot like a Larabar but doesn\\'t quite surpass it in taste.  If you\\'re living by Michael Pollan\\'s dictum (\"the fewer ingredients, the better\"), it plays second fiddle to Larabar as well.This 1.7 oz. snack bar contains nine ingredients.  Although dates place first in the ingredient parade, it is the taste of nuts that is most prevalent in this snack.  Thus, ingredients #2, #3, and #7 (organic cashews, organic walnuts, and organic almonds respectively).  Oddly, organic wild blueberries are the fourth ingredient and are suffused parenthetically with the rather ubiquitous organic apple juice concentrate as well as organic sunflower oil.  Odder still, the natural blueberry is supplemented with ingredient #9, organic blueberry \"flavor.\"  I say odd because this snack does not deliver a powerful blueberry taste, which I like.  Rather, the flavor of blueberry is more of an aftertaste than a hit-your-palate-as-you-chew taste.The product is small but delivers 190 calories, 70 of them from fat (as you might expect from a snack with healthy nuts).  On the plus side, you can\\'t argue with PURE\\'s organic pedigree.  All there, all labeled USDA organic.  Thus, the \"health\" rating is high, though I figured most curious shoppers would take that for granted based on the description.  This rating, then, is based more on taste.  Bottom line?  Not bad.  But not good enough to unseat the established Larabar from its perch, either.',\n",

The Clif bar is 2.4oz (50% larger than the Pure bar), contains 5 grams of fat, 7 grams of fiber, and 10 grams of protein.  Most, but not all, of the ingredients of the Clif bar are organic and they've added vitamins to fortify their bar.  The Pure bars are about $1.57 each, while the Clif bars are about a buck.  All in all, the Clif bars seem to be a better bargain, unless you feel strongly about having every ingredient be organic.\",\n",

When biting into the bar you can taste each ingredient\\'s unique flavor, yet the tastes all go together so well.  Due to the dates and cherries in the bar, it has a slightly \"tangy\" flavor, which leaves a wonderful aftertaste.

I guess this would make a good snack bar, but the calories are kinda high for a snack (190).Compared to the blueberry Pure bar, this has more flavor.  Unfortunately neither bar is filling.  The cherry bar has a nice tart cherry taste.  Those of you looking for something sickly sweet, you will not find it here despite the Agave \"nectar\" (high fructose sugar stuff) that is in it.  If it wasn\\'t for the high fructose agave syrup (they like to make it sound oh so healthy by calling it agave nectar), I would rate this bar a star higher.  I am on a mission to find agave free organic Vegan bars aside from Lara bars & haven\\'t had any sucess.  It is so disappointing that the health food industry has jumped on the cheap sweet Agave rather than something else, like organic maple syrup or untreated organic sugar?  Organic maple syrup is delish, but oops expensive, so I guess I wont be seeing it in any Vegan bars anytime soon.Now if you think I\\'m a loon because of the Agave thing, go ahead & research it.  That\\'s all I have to say.Anyway, if you are not concerned about agave or not looking for something to keep you from being hungry then this is a pretty tasty tart treat.  Maybe this would be better suited as a dessert bar.  Yes, I think so.  This would make a great dessert bar for me if they got rid of the agave!',\n",

So I was excited to try this bar in blueberry; I've been eating the PURE Cherry bars for some time now. I was surprised by the taste of these bars, neither pleasantly nor unpleasantly, just surprised. They were not very sweet - and the cherry bars are. So this was both good and bad. The cherry bars sometimes are too sweet and I feel like I've eaten candy afterward, whereas the blueberry bars have a subtle sweetness with a mellow flavor. The cashews dominate the taste in these. So, for every day fare, (especially for gluten free people) theses are much more grounding and more food-like than candy like. However, it's not necessarily a taste that I would crave every day. But that's me. They are definitely worth adding to your collection of bars - it's always nice to have variety. Enjoy!\",\n",

I like its taste even more than Pure's very good cherry cashew bar.It's very moist and chewy, not dry and sawdusty like so many bars, and if you didn't know it was all raw you'd think it was merely a tasty fruit bar. But unlike most food bars this one is full of enzymes that will help you digest the nutrition herein, instead of dead, denatured ingredients that will just become a brick in your gut. I ate this bar while hiking in the woods and soon felt a real surge of energy, a nice smooth blood sugar plateau that lasted for well over an hour and left no crash or bad feelings thereafter.So: it tastes good, is very good for you, and by supporting organic agriculture you're helping America's small farmers.

But I really would have liked more blueberry flavor. The texture was okay. The bar was more on the hard side, not really soft or chewy. At 190 calories and 6 grams of protein with a whole lot of carbs (26 grams), I would only use this as an occasional snack/meal replacement type thing. Instead of this bar, I'd rather have a small organic salad with protein toppings. For what it is, it is okay. I'd give my kids this over a candy bar any day.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"...but after that, I found eating a PureBar to be something of a task.Pros:Filling--the bar was very dense and, coupled with some water, really sated my hunger.Tasted like real blueberry. There wasn't any artificial aftertaste or flavor to the bar, which was great: it tasted fresh. It even smelled awesome.Portability. Because of the small size of the bar, it can be easily thrown in a bag, glovebox, or backpack to bring with you.Cons:The biggest drawback--and really the only huge drawback-- was the unusual mouth-feel/texture: it was a little too thick/dense for me, and as a result felt undercooked. The texture also didn't lend itself to the size of the bar; my jaw got tired trying to chew it.Nuts. I don't like nuts in most things, and found the walnuts (?) included in the bar to overwhelm the taste. If there weren't nuts, this probably would have gotten a four star rating.Bottom line:The blueberry Pure Bar that I ate was generally disappointing. The taste was fine, but the inclusion of nuts added too much of a bitter flavor. Coupled with the texture of the product, it wasn't an overwhelmingly enjoyable experience to eat (and really, who likes to eat things they don't enjoy?). In the future, I could imagine purchasing these for day-hikes or camping trips, or to throw along a long running or cycling route. But it's not a product I would include in my day-to-day diet.\",\n",

It is an awesome little packet of nutrition : it has a full serving of fruit, rich in Omega-3's, is a good source of fiber, has raw unprocessed ingredients and is vegan.Where flavor is concerned, it was a little tart for my 8 year old (who has celiac) but I liked the cashew-cherry combination . There are chunks of cashew in the bar so it has a nice texture too.However, where the allergy information is concerned the package states that 'this product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, fish and tree nuts'.I know that there are different degrees to which people with celiac disease (and other gluten related issues) avoid Gluten. I started out avoiding anything that was made in a facility that processed gluten. Under that criteria I would not have bought these bars.I now avoid items if they are made on machinery that is also used to process items that contain gluten so the bars are ok by my current standards but I did think that it should be mentioned since the facility is not a dedicated gluten free facility and some of us do tend to need/want that.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have been a very healthy organic foods eater for over 12 years.  My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track. Some other theses I really like, others aren't so tasty for me.  (Amazon.com does not sell these at the time of this review.)If you found my review helpful, please click the YES button below.  Thank you and good eating!\",\n",

Indeed, it only weighs 1.7 ounces (48g), a little on the small side for a \"granola\" or \"energy\" bar.Upon tasting it, however, I was pleasantly surprised. It is moist, chewy, satisfying, and unlike some \"blueberry\" products, really does have a taste of blueberry overall.Weighing in at 190 calories, I was satisfied for several hours after eating this bar. I ate it before teaching a 3 hour class, and was not hungry for the duration. 6 grams of protein surely helped in this.The package said it was a \"Raw fruit and nut bar,\" so I was expecting big chunks of nuts and a lot of chewing. Instead, there were only a few walnut chunks, and a pleasant lack of sugary goo holding it together. Whatever blending process was involved created a nicely palatable eating experience.For you ciliacs out there, this is also gluten-free. That said, non-ciliacs should not adopt a gluten-free diet for no reason - you\\'ll lose your tolerance if you avoid glutens.Everything in this bar is organic - which must explain the outrageous price. At an MSRP of two fifty per bar, this is a difficult value to justify, delicious as it is. You\\'d probably be better off buying loose nuts and dried fruits on your own, and you\\'d spend about a quarter of the money per gram of food as you would here.And this is too bad - because this is one tasty bar.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The first thing you should know about these bars, they are not granola bars. \"Raw fruit & nut bar\" sounds like it could be a light snack with big chunks of fruit and nuts, but this is much closer to a dense protein bar. Which is not a bad thing, so long as you are expecting it. Here are the details:* All organic ingredients! Very impressive resume here, which would fit any type of healthy lifestyle.* Flavor is good, only slightly sweet, and the occasional chunks of nuts are nice. Be aware that it contains dates, walnuts, cashews and almonds.* Size is good, may be a little smaller than you expect, but any bigger and you may start to feel full halfway through. Perfect size for a slightly heavy snack.* Calories are not bad at 190, compared to some other dense bars, but nutritional value is a little skewed for anyone looking for a healthy snack. At 190 calories, I hope for more than 4g of fiber and 6g of protein, especially when it packs 9g of fat. I enjoy many 100-140 calorie granola bars with less fat and more fiber.I prefer the tangy flavor of thePure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)over this blueberry one.This is a solid energy bar that would be well suited for a snack before/during a workout, long hike, intense bike ride, any kind of activity where a lighter granola bar would not be enough energy. I have eaten similar bars in the past (Cliff, Kashi GoLean, Zone, I forget how many others) and this is probably my favorite of the bunch. 4/5 stars only because I would expect more fiber in 190 calorie bar.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"If you're interested in getting your hands on a chewy, healthy, satisfying little snack, definitely consider adding these to your shopping cart!The bars aren't large - about 1 1/4 inches wide by a little over 4 inches long, and about a half inch thick - but they're packed with good, fresh, healthy flavour. The bars are nicely chewy without being gummy, and have far more flavor and are far more palatable (in my opinion) than those fruit leather strips out there. These really are almost like a chewy fruit and nut brownie in the way they're made. I do have to say, though, that if you're not a walnut lover, beware, as walnuts are the nuts that I found in the greatest supply in my bar. As the ingredients list cites walnuts as one of the nuts used, after the fact I wasn't so surprised, but since they are called cherry cashew fruit and nut bars, I was expecting to see more cashews.As the ingredients and their prevalence go, they are listed as such on the bar (everything being organic, I'm going to skip typing that out seven times): dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate (whatever that is), walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds, all raw and unprocessed.Speaking of fruit leather, these bars are about that sort of color - reddish brown, with a look of pureed fruit that's had nuts mixed into it. I do like that these are certified organic, gluten-free, raw, vegan, and contain a full serving of fruit, plenty of omega 3 fatty acids, organic protein and 3 grams of fiber per bar. I have to say, though, that I'm not keen on the fact that each little bar has 8 grams of fat, but considering that they're nut fats, they're much healthier than the other fats that might make their way into your diet.Overall, I really enjoyed the bar that I tried. It was a satisfying sweet, chewy treat without being either too sweet or too tart. The perfect little dessert bite for a healthy lunch, or a delicious afternoon snack. If you happen to see these in your local grocery's health food section, pick one up to try it, then come back to Amazon and treat yourself to a whole bunch of 'em at a better price than you're apt to find locally!*UPDATE*Ever since I had that first cherry cashew Pure bar, I've thought about them often. I've seen them in my local Trader Joe's (which I'm an AVID fan of), as well as my local Kroger/Ralph's and a few other stores in their health food/protein & health bar aisles. I've continued to think about buying them there, but the prices that they sell them for in my local area put them at about $1.99 - $2.49 each, if not more. Being the frugal soul that I am, I just knew I'd find them for less here. At just under twenty bucks for a 12 count box, these work out to about $1.67 a bar here up front. If, however, you opt to subscribe to the product (which I often do on Amazon, at a twice-yearly shipment subscription), they come out to $1.40 per bar, WITH free shipping. Needless to say, I'm sold! My first box is on its way to me right now, and I'll be able to enjoy a delicious, sweet, chewy, HEALTHY dessert-like treat whenever I want one now! Yummy! Can't WAIT for my box to arrive!Try one! They're delicious!\",\n",

It's similar in taste to other brands I've tried, but is a bit nuttier and denser. It's first ingredient is dates, which make a dense chewy bar, but there's enough cherries in it to give it a good cherry taste.  In addition to the nuts (cashews, walnuts and almonds) and fruit, there's organic rice protein concentrate. Not sure what that is - or how it is not cooked or processed, but yet concentrate? And also organic agave nectar.Not exactly a cheap snack, but not too bad for a raw organic one. And much more filling and satisfying than a candy bar - not to mention the health differences.\",\n",

The cherry flavor is pretty heavy making it a little sweet and it's well balanced out by the cashews in it.  (I really love cashews and I would have been OK with even more, but they nailed the combination of flavors.)When I took a bite into the bar my 7 year old wanted to try it so I let her.  On a child's taste buds she liked it at first bite, but after she had a chance to chew and swallow she was less enthusiastic and declined a second bite.I think this bar is for a more mature palate, but I suppose a child could get used to it.

So I cannot say if the flavor is consistent between bars and I cannot judge if all are supposed to taste like this.As advertised, this is an Organic & Raw product. So if you have never had raw cashews, cherries or dates, you may not get the flavor you expect, especially with the cashews. Most people are used to them salted and roasted. In this bar, the dates and walnuts were the dominate flavor, not the cherries or the cashews. It tasted more like a raisin walnut bar, than a cherry cashew bar.The bar is a little small compared to most snack bars, about an inch and a half by three inches and the package is a little deceptive in that is larger than the bar by over an inch.Overall, I can't give it a high rating since the Cherry and Cashew flavor is dominated by the Date and Walnut. And as I said, I only have one bar to try, so I don't know if others are better, but for the price I would expect the flavor listed to be correct and the bars to be a bit bigger.\",\n",

Agave does sound exotic, and suggestive of all sorts of healing properties, but truth be told it's not terribly different from corn syrup at the nutritional level- it consists of anywhere from 56% to 92% fructose, with the remainder being glucose, and trace amounts of flavor compounds.The bulk of the bar is dried dates, nuts, and cherries, ground up and formed into something that looks rather like the inside of a Fig Newton bar. As for taste... well, it tastes rather like the inside of a Fig Newton bar. GIven that these cost, on a per ounce basis, about five times what Fig Newtons cost, I'd expect something a bit tastier.

What I enjoyed about the cherry cashew is that it had more flavor than the blueberry and wasn't overly sweet. In fact, there was a nice little tart kick. I like the ingredient list, although I've read there is some controversy about agave nectar. I offered my husband a taste, and he didn't want to try it since he doesn't like cherries. He'd tried the blueberries and was less than impressed. Finally, he agreed to have a nibble, and said that he liked it, and definitely preferred it to the blueberry. So, the bar converted a cherry hater. :)I'd purchase this flavor again, definitely.\",\n",

The bar itself looked very unappealing, like something that had been made with an industrial extruder into which someone threw blueberries, oats and other healthy-type food. At least it smelled edible. The bar is definitely blueberry flavor, but with a twist. Imagine if you had a piece of blueberry pie while you were out at a nice hillside picnic. Now imagine that you dropped your pie piece and it rolled down the hill and into a nearby forest, all the while collecting dirt, leaves, twigs and other detritus. Now eat that pie.

I give it 5 stars because the quality is there, the rest is just catering to your tastes.My first Pure bar was the Wild Blueberry.  They are fine for what they are. Blueberries, cashews and almonds. I like them well enough that I bought again, and will continue.I then tried the Chocolate Brownie with primary ingredients of cocoa and walnuts.  Once again, they are fine. Compared to other dreadful bars out there, they are good.I tried Larabars, which are similar, but ultimately don't like them.  The only other bars I like are the Kind series.  But, they are not exactly bars. The are just nuts formed together in hardened syrup.  Still good if you want the crunch of nuts.  But Pure Bars are actual bars that taste like a treat.  Something to keep you away from the candy aisle.With that said, I've pretty much said these are &#34;fine&#34;.. not great.  I've been endlessly waiting for &#34;great&#34;.  Well, I finally found my Pure match in Dark Chocolate Berry.  Raspberries, cranberries, almonds and cocoa. So very good, I'm getting more right now.  When was the last time you have looked forward to one of these kind of bars?  I can't say that I have.  I will continue getting the blueberry bars, as they are appealing in the morning.  But my problem is wanting to be bad at night. And this brings out my dark side in all the right ways.I still want to try the coconut options of Cashew Coconut and Banana Coconut.  And I notice the variety pack contains the three I mentioned, and banana coconut. So that will be a good choice, just in case I don't love it, I will like the rest.  But if you are considering any of these, I highly suggest the variety pack to get you started.\",\n",

Most of them are not really that healthful; when you look at the ingredients list, they have various types of sugars disguised as health foods (not!) and processed ingredients that do not benefit the health in any way.  The ones that are actually healthful tend to taste lousy--either too sweet, too cardboard-like, or too bland.This bar is different.  One bite, and I thought, \"Wonder if there\\'s anyplace nearby that carries these.\"  They contain nothing cooked and nothing processed, so already they\\'re a step ahead of most of the fare available at health food stores and in grocery health food aisles.  Moreover, they taste great!  They really taste like cherries--no, not those maraschino cherries they put in mixed drinks, loaded with dyes and sugar--but real cherries.  They\\'re delightfully chewy, have some organic rice protein in them to keep your blood sugar from skyrocketing, and to top it off, they\\'re gluten-free, certified organic, and rich in omega-3s and fiber.  They\\'re raw and vegan.  If you\\'ve ever tried a bar that meets those criteria, I can virtually guarantee it didn\\'t taste like this one.  Yes, it does have 17 grams of sugar, and that\\'s a lot, but it\\'s all natural sugar, and most natural bars similar to it have more.  It\\'s the amount of natural sugar you would get from eating a small serving or two of cherries and a couple of handfuls of nuts.I don\\'t believe people need to give up the good life to go raw, natural, and organic; bars like this one prove me right!',\n",

I also had my kids try them both to get their opinions (which were strong) and I will share those also.  The Wild Blueberry was tried after the Cherry Cashew which was a good thing.  The Cherry Cashew was pretty tart and the kids didn\\'t care for it much (they are 8 and 11 yrs old).  The Wild Blueberry, however, was a hit.  Personally, I liked both but I like tart things and so it wasn\\'t an issue for me like it was for the kids.  The Wild Blueberry was definitely sweeter.  I am surprised that they didn\\'t put \"Almond\" in the name of this bar as it is a prevalent flavor--especially since they mention the cashews in the title of the Cherry Cashew bar.  I think \"Blueberry Almond\" would probably be a better name for this bar.  The packaging seems pretty standard and shows what the creator of the bar (Veronica)looks like in a cartoon version on the front.It is gluten free and full of organic, organic, organic (almost every ingredient has the word \"organic\" before it).All in all, the Wild Blueberry Pure Organic Bar is tasty, sweet, and appeals to the kids.

I was provided a sample to review for the Vine program.

No artificial pesticides etc. Yay earth.(4) Loaded with vitamins and minerals. See point (1).(5) Not all that high in calories (190 for the bar we samples), compared to other snack bars.(6) They\\'re not as dry and crumbly as, say, granola bars are.(7) Gluten free, for those it matters to.Cons:(1) Negative eye appeal. These things just don\\'t look appetizing.(2) They *taste* indisputably healthy and good for you.  I rather liked them, especially given the chewiness factor, but I let my two children try a bite, and they were unimpressed.In sum, I think these would be great to carry on backpacking trips, and I like that they don\\'t crumble into a million pieces when you try to eat them.

These are organic and not cooked or processed.  I would still rather pay more if I could afford it to buy these organic brownies. You'll definitely want to try.  I hesitated to buy these but I'm glad I did.  I expected some dry or dull tasting organic snack but their as good as real brownies just not as sugary but definitely sweet because of the natural sugar from the dates and organic agave nectar which has a lower glycemic count than sugar.  Their very moist, sweet, but not sweet like a refined sugar.  Package says certified usda organic so i'm hoping they are truely organic but I'm very wary even when they label them especially with some organic companies using unfiltered city water which is not safe and in some cases fluoridated.  No thanks on the fluoride.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I was pleasantly surprised by the intense and varied flavor of this bar, given that it contains only raw and natural ingredients (and by natural, they mean NATURAL.  There are no vague ingredients like \"other natural flavors.\"  The ingredients listed above in the description are all that are in it.  I didn\\'t even know it was possible to make a bar without artificial preservatives, that still has an expiration date that isn\\'t until next year!I am not on a raw food diet, nor am I a vegetarian or vegan, but I can say that with these bars handy to grab in the morning, I will be happy to switch at least ONE meal a day to raw food vegan!  I didn\\'t even know products like these were available.I got one bar free as a sample, and NEVER expected to purchase more.  I am back on Amazon today to buy a whole box of these!By the way, if you don\\'t like TART flavors, you won\\'t like this. The dried cherries (coupled with a lack of refined added sugar) make for a very naturally tart bar.  Personally, I like it that way -- enough with the dull \"beige\" flavoring in many processed foods!  :-)Oh, and one added bonus -- unlike with other bars, I didn\\'t feel hungry an hour later.  People have commented on the bars being too small, but I think they are just right (at least for me).  Actually, all bars like this tend to be small, it\\'s just that some are longer and skinnier, which makes them seem bigger.  I\\'ve noticed that the weight is about the same - it\\'s just that Pure\\'s bar is short and thick, and that makes it seem so smaller.UPDATE:I liked these enough to buy a box (also bought the apple cinnamon, which I also like a lot.)  I find that I like the taste of them even more if I store them in the refrigerator.  Yum...especially as the summer heat is coming!  :-)',\n",

Calorie content in those bars tends to be fine, but that\\'s about it.  They are full of sugar and preservatives and somehow make me feel both gross and hungry when I eat them.  Though I understand the philosophy of \"everything in moderation,\" I think I\\'ve found something better in the Pure bars.  Calories are similar (190), but the ingredients are completely different.  Rather than being similar to a candy bar, these Pure bars are a simple mix of fruits and nuts, along with rice protein and agave nectar.  All of it is raw, organic, and straightforward, to the extent that it really tastes like something I\\'d make for myself.  The consistency is smooth and dense, with some nut chunks to add a bit of texture.  The blueberry flavor and consistency is pleasant and reminds me of fresh blueberries, rather than the somewhat metallic artificial blueberry flavor found in many munchies I\\'ve munched on.There are no mysteries to these bars, so I think you can make a pretty good guess at whether they fit into your life or not.  If they do, the only question is if it is worth the cost for the convenience or if you\\'d rather make your own.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This bar was advertised as a raw, uncooked food bar, gluten free. Initial impression upon eating the bar was that there was a good strong smell and taste of blueberry, without that blueberry flavor being cloying and artificial as it sometimes is with a blueberry muffin. The bars were about 190 calories each and every ingredient was labeled as \"Organic\". 8 grams (70kcal) of fat, probably from the nuts and the Sunflower oil. They tasted like something you\\'d want to eat.  At 26 grams of carbs per bar, with only 2 grams of fiber, and 19 grams of sugar, this bar might not fit into your diet.  But my wife thought that two of these with a bottle of water would make a great 400 calorie lunch with zero prep.  A bar was about the size of six monopoly dice. and was 1.7 us OZ or 48 grams (come on, folks, round numbers - 2 US ounces or 50 grams).The five star rating came solely from the taste and mouthfeel.They claimed that there was \"nothing cooked\" in the bar.  I found that confusing.  Concentrates, like Orange Juice Concentrate, are cooked - they are heated until the water reduces. I likve near plants that produce such concentrate, and it is cooked. These bars contain, for example, \"Organic rice protein concentrate\", \"Organic apple concentrate\" and \"organic lemon juice concentrate. I put that those ingredients have to be cooked to be concentrated, or at least processed, and the \"Organic Rice Protein Concentrate\" has to be cooked or processed, somehow, to separate the rice protein from the rice starch.  According to the product FAQ page the brown rice protein (arguably not this rice protein) protein is raw because their supplier uses a natural enzyme to separate the protein from the carbohydrate bur the label claims \"nothing processed\" and the use of an enzyme has to count as processing.Now, they do claim to be gluten free, and nothing that is listed as an ingredient in the bar should be a source of gluten.  They support the Celiac Disease foundation openly on their label - so if you are afflicted with celiac, you might want to carry these tasty little bars with you for an afternoon pick-me-up or even a meal replacement.I got my bar free from the Vine program.  I think I\\'m gonna go out and get me a couple of these, if I can find them for less than $3 each.',\n",

The bar certified organic by Quality Assurance International(QAI), which is a reputable company.  Nutritional information states 8 grams of fat per serving and 7 grams of protein with only 5mg of sodium.  Obviously not a protein bar by any measure. My surprise was that the bar only contains 3 grams of fiber.  I suggest you read the nutritional information carefully before buying.  As many of my friends told me, the bar essentially serves no purpose other than a snack.The rough part (pun intended) of consuming this bar is that I almost broke a tooth.  The package indicates \"May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.\"  They were not kidding. At my 2nd bite, I though I was chewing on a small rock and actually checked the entire bar for metal or some similar material.  Turns out I chewed on a nut shell and very hard cherry stem at one point.They meant it when they named the bar \"Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.\"  Chew carefully.  Note however, that my observation is not necessarily negative in this regard.  Many organic foods present similar conditions.',\n",

I was expecting sort of a fig newton looking item, but it is dark and rich in color (I've uploaded a photo).  I can taste the cherry, the cashews, and it is quite filling.  It's rather chewy, too.  The wrapper says that the bar was not cooked at all, and nothing was processed, and it lists the ingredients that could cause allergies -- which is where it kind of stunned me because among the regular items you would expect in an organic fruit and nut bar like nuts, milk, eggs -- fish is listed too! So vegans and vegetarians, be wary!The carb count is rather high at 25g, and there are 190 calories and 3g of fiber.  This is actually something I would buy and keep a little stash of in my office drawer.Recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'One thing I like about fruit and nut bars is the different tastes that each successive bite gives you. When one particular part of the bar has more nuts, you get the taste of nuts, and when there is more fruit in a particular bite you get a taste of fruit. This results in not just variety of taste but also variety of texture. Although these organic cherry cashew, raw fruit and nut bars are clearly composed of several different types of food, they are mixed together in the final product so that the taste and texture is pretty uniform. That said, I did not particularly mind the taste or texture themselves. The bars are definitely not too sweet and the texture of the bar, somewhat chewy, is pretty good. Still, in the end, I cannot honestly say that, if given my pick of fruit and nut bars, that I would pick this product over any number of other snack bars I have tasted in the past.',\n",

So I was excited to try the new Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.  This is the kind of thing that I eat for a snack on a regular basis, and I'm always looking for new things to mix into my rotation.  Unfortunately, this product will not be one of the ones that I add.I'm not going to address the nutrition aspects because at a basic level you have to like a product first.  I had a couple of issues with the blueberry bar that I tried.  First, the nuts in the bar are soggy and as such not as crisp as I prefer.  I like the crunch that the almonds in Kashi's TLC Honey Almond Flax bars have much better than what the Pure bar had.  Second, the overall texture seemed very gritty and muddy (I don't like pinto beans for similar reasons).  I thought the blueberry flavor was OK, but it was not enough to overcome the other issues that I mentioned.So, there's still a chance that you might like these wild blueberry bars.  However, if your tastes are like mine, you're going to want to pass.

Maybe that\\'s why it doesn\\'t need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future. Smells a lot like fruitcake, too.

It\\'s tastier than I\\'d anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary. I think I might like this.Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all - I found a tooth-crunching pit in my Cherry-flavored bar - the wrapper states, \"May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.\")I will recommend this bar to anyone who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I\\'ve sampled.',\n",

However, if you want ingredients that are raw, vegan (though produced in a facility that processes milk & egg), organic, and non-GMO, there are only a few to choose from.  Of course, neither Pure or Larabar have any high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils.This product runs about $1.50 to $1.70 per bar, which is comparable to the other similar items on the market.

It tastes kind of like a blueberry wheat-biscuit breakfast cereal that has been blended into paste and formed into a bar. It's not bad tasting, but it's nothing I'd ever crave, either. It's probably very good for my body, but then, so is just eating a bowl of blueberries and cashews, and the bowl of fruit and nuts would be much tastier than this.There's not much to expand on, here. It's pretty much what you'd expect from this type of gluten-free, organic, all-natural snack bar. It does little to shake the preconception of it being rabbit food, and despite being healthy, it does nothing to make me forget my craving for a bacon cheeseburger and a bag of chocolate-covered raisins. In short, this is the kind of snack that reminds me why I would never embrace a gluten-free or vegan diet unless my life depended on it.If you do happen to be a vegan, or need gluten-free snacks, or just need to keep a full serving of fruit in your pocket for travel, this is a good choice for you. I endorse it as one of the better bars of its kind. They get four stars for selling a product that tastes OK, is just as natural as they advertised, and seems to be affordable considering the contents.My advice: Definitely buy it if you're into this kind of thing. Avoid it if you don't feel any guilt over craving a chocolate bar.\",\n",

All of them have 16g of sugar, except the dark chocolate berry bar, which has 17g.  Looking at the ingredients, just about everything provides some sugar, even if it isn\\'t refined sugar.  Lots of fruit, which I expected, but is agave nectar really needed as an ingredient for all of them?  Some have it for the second ingredient.  After a quick internet search, I found this statement, with lots of information to back it up: \"Agave nectar is bad for you. It\\'s not traditional, not natural, highly refined, and contains more concentrated fructose than high fructose corn syrup.\"  The bars all have 190 or 200 calories, and 1.7oz in weight.  Lots of calories for little volume.  They all have 6g of protein.  I\\'m going to keep looking.',\n",

The bits of walnut are perfect and add a little crunch to the smooth texture of the bar.  I would highly recommend this product.  The lack of overpowering sweetness is probably what lets it be a snack bar instead of a real brownie.\",\n",

Most of the bulk comes from a variety of nuts and the sweetness comes from nectar and apple juice concentrate.

As a busy mom who needs stuff like this to carry with me while I\\'m out to keep my calories coming (yay breastfeeding!) I\\'ve been fond of Luna Bars (Luna - Chocolate Peppermint Bar 15x1.69 OZ for a while now. But they don\\'t really have a fruity option I like. So I decided to try out these Pure Bars.Firstly, I\\'m not much of a health nut though I try to be health concious to a point. These bars are certified organic, gluten-free, contain no refined sugars, dairy or soy, preservatives or trans fats, they\\'re packed with Omega-3s and fiber and they are vegan. The fat content is a little high (I\\'m suffering with gallbladder disease and fats are not our friend) for something I would consider a snack in that long stretch between lunch and dinner but they\\'re the healthy fats found in nuts.But what about the taste? I\\'m surprised to be honest. Most \"health bars\" have a chalky taste that may not appear at first but becomes an after taste when you\\'ve finished. Since these are made with raw fruit and nuts, a little rice protein and sweetened with agave nectar they taste amazing! I\\'m not sure about any of the other flavors but if you like nuts and cherries the Cherry Cashew one is so gooood. :D The texture of the fruit is smooth, almost creamy and the nuts add just a little crunch.I think the price is a little too steep for these to become my regular diaper bag snack staple but considering they\\'re organic and mostly fruit and nuts they\\'re not really that expensive. I\\'ll definitely recommend them to some of my other mommy pals (especially nursing moms who need healthy but calorie rich options) and the family vegan.',\n",

Unlike the popular yet brick-like LaraBars which are also made of raw fruits and nuts, PURE ORGANIC Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are a much lighter and more enjoyable choice if you\\'re in search of a healthy alternative to the usual (and chemical and sugar loaded) \"protein\" and \"health\" bars out there.The Wild Blueberry bar is sweet and chewy and you can really taste the blueberries....and it tastes like REAL blueberries, not the Pop Tart phony \"blueberry flavor.\"  The almonds and cashews in this bar aren\\'t as noticeable as they are in the other bars that feature them but they make the blueberry bar very tasty and chewy.I really loved the Cherry Cashew bar mostly because I have a propensity for things that are tart. The cherries are so delicious and are a perfect compliment to the cashews that you get in every single bite. Just sweet enough but also surprisingly tart - a perfect balance of both flavors.The great thing about these completely pure and raw snack bars is that you actually feel satisfied after you\\'ve eaten one and it fulfills any craving you might have for something sweet.  At 190 calories per bar, you\\'re getting a really healthy \"sweet fix\" with all of the benefits of pure protein, fiber, and a lot of important extra vitamins that you certainly wouldn\\'t get by indulging your sweet tooth with a pre-fab candy bar or one of the completely unhealthy \"protein\" bars that are laden with harmful ingredients most people can\\'t even pronounce.Pure Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are my new favorite snack!!',\n",

The consistency is sort of pasty, but it did have a nice (date) flavor, rather than the bland, soy taste. The bar is vitamin enriched, although it's not overloaded. The price per bar if bought using Amazon's Subscribe and Save option is very competitive at less than $1.50/bar. My guess is that the stores will charge closer to $2 each for these.

It tastes good and it claims to contain \"nothing cooked, nothing processed,\" but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains \"agave nectar\" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a \"healthy alternative\" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don\\'t understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this \"raw\" bar, and second, they used \"agave nectar\" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used \"agave nectar\" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.You can research for yourself, google \"agave nectar bad\"and look for entries from \"foodrenegade,\" \"nourishedkitchen\" and \"living-foods\"You can also google \"fructose bad\"check out the hits from \"about\" and \"the american journal of clinical nutrition\"Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you\\'re in, \"agave nectar\" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims \"nothing cooked and nothing processed\" is nothing short of fraud.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I love that this is made gluten and dairy free with natural raw ingredients.  That says a lot for a snack bar.  I wanted to like this for that reason but I just found it to be short on flavor.  I wonder if I were someone who never ate refined sugar if this would taste more flavorful to me.  The blueberry flavor was just so mild.  I make fresh juices every morning and always use fresh blueberries so perhaps I am used to that and just couldn't taste too much of the flavor in these.  I ate it over a period of about three days.  I wanted to try it at different times but my palate just never had a craving for it.  Had I really liked it, it wouldn't have made the three days I'm sure.  It has a very chewy texture and the blueberry flavor is similar to that you'd find in a muffin.  It's not bad, but there's just not enough flavor for my tastes.  If you are looking for a bar with these ingredients as a snack to get you through the day and ingredients are more important than flavor, this could be a good bar for you.\",\n",

This is like a bar that you would make in a food processor if you had the time and all the ingredients at hand. Those who are used to an American diet of relatively high sodium and sugar will probably be underwhelmed by the taste. However, for those who like dried fruits and nuts in the convenience of a bar form, I would recommend these esp. when they are on sale. I am not a raw foodie but I tend to like many fruit based foods in a relatively natural state - i.e. straight from the tree or sun dried rather than cooked in pies or cookies. Take a look at the photos included on this page- they are very accurate. The bars are moist but not sticky; the nuts are chopped in small chunks which I like and no peanuts! (Peanuts are fine but IMO overused in many recipes). I tend to prefer almonds and walnuts but again these are more subtle flavors so this mix may not suit all- just know your own palate.',\n",

It has chunkier bits of nuts and fruit than the LaraBar also.This Blueberry bar is my second flavor to try (I tried the Cherry flavor first)and it is delicious! There are actual dried whole blueberries in the bar which give it a nice sweetness and very real blueberry flavor. In my experience, blueberry flavored anything can usually have a fake or chemically kind of taste but this does not at all.I highly recommend this bar!...and an extra bonus: Both my 4 and 2 year old LOVED this bar, as did my 19 yr old brother so pack these puppies as a healthy snack for your kids!\",\n",

The protein is low for what I need to get out of the 48gram bar and the carbs fair to high, in comparison.  The blueberry comes through wonderfully, but the heaviness of the rice protein muddies it, leaving the overall bar a bit flavorless.  That it is organic is a plus, and I notice that it specifically says on the wrapper \"Certified Organic.\"  What concerns me is that it does not say, \"Certified Gluten-free.\"  This would be of particular interest to someone with Celiac disease, especially since it does not say it is wheat-free and notes that the bars are made in a facility that processes wheat.All-in-all, if you\\'re not dealing with food allergies, the bar is OK.

These are amazing - really delicious and good for you, with whole food ingredients you can recognize, and they're made in Michigan! Fruits and nuts and honey - it doesn't get better than that. My kids loved them, too, which makes me happy because they're sweet enough to satisfy an urge for a candybar but so much better for you.The blueberry taste was real because the blueberries are real! The only icky thing in this bar was canola oil, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.\",\n",

The bar was too wet and soft for me.  It wasn't wet like a fig newton but like double the moisture content at least.  You can actually see and feel how wet this organic bar is.  The flavor was a bit bland (depending where you bit) and nothing special that I would look for again especially after being turned off by the soft consistency and high moisture content of the bar.  There were bursts of blueberry flavor within areas of the bar, some nutty texture, but am not sure (by view or mouthfeel) what else was in there.  I wasn't even sure what kinds of nuts were in the bar while I ate it.  The only way I'd know what was in there besides blueberries was by reading the label.  The bar itself looked like some kind of brownish/greyish wet clay square.Some may like it because of the natural products but I cannot see myself trying this again, even if free.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I wasn\\'t sure what to expect after oping the Pure Organic Cherry/Cashew Fruit & Nut Bar.  It looked really dense, sticky and a bit darker than I expected.  But even for my trepidation it tasted pretty darn good.  It certainly has the tart tang of dried cherries, but the overall taste is rather mild.  There were also plenty of nuts though I was expecting the bar to be a little more crunchy.  Also, the bar contains more fruit and nuts than described on the front including dates, almonds, and walnuts which account for most of the bar.  I saw more walnuts and almonds than cashews.Overall I was a little disappointed in the bar.  Though it tastes alright, for all it\\'s touting of organic, unprocessed ingredients it\\'s kind of heavy for what you\\'re really getting.  One bar contains 190 calories, 8g of fat, 25g of carbs (17g of which are sugar and only 3g of fiber).  Granted you\\'re getting 7g of protein, so it would certainly work as a meal replacement except that it\\'s not all that satisfying at 1.7oz.  In checking some labels in my kitchen, the Pure bar has roughly the same nutritional elements as an M&M; brand ice-cream cone, and has more twice the fat of a comparable serving ofNature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars, Fruit & Nut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)(though the rest matches up pretty much the same.)  At almost $3 a bar these are also a bit pricey for what you\\'re getting.Also, it touts to have no processed ingredients which is misleading.  It\\'s alluding to the idea that it doesn\\'t contain ingredients that have been chemically altered or cooked, but processed foods doesn\\'t just mean hot dogs and Spam.  Processed foods also refer to those that have been chopped, refined, or changed from their state in nature, and the chopped nuts, dried fruit, and extracted organic rice protein are processed (not to mention the formation of the bars, which contrary to the packages\\' description do not \"kinda grow on trees...\")  The reason I\\'m mentioning this is that the Pure brand is using a lot of healthy buzz words to allude to the utterly healthy nature of the bars, which they are if you consider each one is almost fit to be a meal onto itself.',\n",

(unless you count the 14 essential vitamins and minerals, healthy antioxidants, and healthy Omega 3 fats in every bite). Nothing cooked. Nothing processed.These bars use certified organic fruits, nuts and grains, are gluten-free, vegan, and contain a full serving of fruit.  I have tried many different types of snack and meal bars as I am always on the go or too busy to sit and eat a complete meal at lunch - these bars are great and I will probably purchase many more!After trying the bar, I went to the company website to learn more and now I feel really good about these bars and the company that manufactures them.  They are a very responsible / Eco-friendly company started by a mom who really cares about what her family eats AND they are an American company located in Holland Michigan!

Both have orgaqnic dates listed as the first ingredient, making me think that \"date\" ought to be mentioned in the names of each bar. Note that in this wild blueberry bar blueberries are listed as the fifth ingredient.I like that the Pure Bars have and organic philosophy and contain wholesome ingredients. The bar is 3\" by 1.5\", so it\\'s relatively small and calorie dense. I could easily eat two or three of these at one sitting even though the nearly 600 calories would be better chosen than those consumed in a greasy burger or salty fries.The heavy bar looks and feels like raw dough or an undercooked brownie in texture. I like the taste of the blueberry much better than that of the cherry bar though one is hard pressed to detect blueberry flavor in a bar dominated more by dates and nuts.In short, this bar satisfies with its taste and choice of wholesome ingredients.

I am always looking for a bar that is healthy, with little additives and fillers.  We are also big on organic fruits, so that element of the bar also caught my attention.  The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew was a nice surprise.  I love cherries and cashews, so this was an appealing combination to me.  The bar itself is made up of a lot of date paste, but compared to other bars I have tried recently (the ProBar was NOT a hit), the date was NOT the overwhelming flavor, nor was the consistency too pasty.  It had a nice texture and was not overly chewy.  There was a pleasant tart cherry flavor throughout the bar, and the bar itself was not overly sweet.  There were just two things I did not like about the bar.  There seemed to be too many nuts in the bar I got, and they did not taste fresh.  They lacked any \"crunch\" and seemed a bit stale tasting.  It also seemed like within 5 bites, the bar was gone.  It would be fine for a snack, but I would never use it as a meal replacement--it leaves you wanting something else to eat when you are done with it.  Overall, a good choice for a bar if you are looking for something other than chocolate or peanut butter bars that seem to abundant in the bar market.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I've always avoided nutrition bars for a few reasons: 1) I hate that protein powder-taste that many of them have, as well as that rice-crispie texture that many of the other  (like Luna bars) have.  2) They tend to have so many calories and processed sugar, I might as well have a Snickers.Not so with raw fruit bars, like Pure Organics (and Larabars).  I've been a Larabar devotee for awhile now, particularly their cherry pie and gingers bars.  But I've been curious about Pure Organics and finally got a chance to try one.  I tried the cherry cashew bar because I love love love cashews.  I've got to say, it's a pretty tasty bar.  But I still like my cherry pie larabar better, because it's, well, cherry-er (the cherry pie Larabar, though, uses almonds instead of cashews).  This one's nothing to sneeze at, and I'll take it over a Luna bar anyday, but I'm probably not going to switch out of my Larabar loyalty, at least not for this flavor.Still, I highly recommend bars like Pure Organic or Larabar over other nutrition bars.  One is a single serving of fruit, they are all-natural, and though they do have sugar, it's the kind that comes with fiber, so you fill up, and you don't have the crazy blood sugar drop that you get with refined sugar.  So, definitly try one!\",\n",

Around ten or eleven o' clock my blood sugar starts to get a little low and I start feeling drowsy (I never have been a breakfast eater) and candy bars are out of the question for a long-term solution. While these bars are okay, they are not the solution I was looking for.They taste like a combination of a Power Bar and a Fruit Roll-Up. They are dense and not particularly appetizing. I don't get a perceptible energy boost from eating them either. Those who are accustomed to a strictly organic or low-sugar diet will probably like the taste more, but for me they are just okay.

Blueberries are the most powerful berries for keeping your veins and arteries strong. I found this out when my elderly father fell and hit his head. When I found out that even a small bump can cause several clots, I read extensively on how to make the arteries and veins way stronger, and blueberries really do the job. All the berries- strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries and cherries also contain these amazing properties, but the blueberry is the best.When I first opened the wrapper on this blueberry bar, the blueberry aroma was wonderful and strong! You can see all the wonderful blueberries and nuts inside. Even though the ingredients consist of dates, cashews, walnuts, rice concentrate, wild blueberries, apple juice, sunflower oil, nectar, almonds and lemon juice, I could only taste the blueberries and walnuts. The texture is similar to a fig bar, with nuts added. Wonderfully, there is no refined sugar (great for waistlines and diabetics), no gluten, dairy or soy, no cholesterol (great for the arteries), no sodium (great for the heart), no trans fats and no preservatives.This 3 1/4 by 1 1/2 inch bar has 190 calories, which isn't bad, considering it's composed of natural fruit and nuts and does not contain damaging refined sugar. Any food under 200 calories is easy to burn off, so this is a great snack for the waist. The benefits of the nuts and blueberries is huge with the omega 3 properties, fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Blueberries have been called the healthiest food on the planet with it's powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. They slow the aging process and reduce cell damage that can lead to cancer, not to mention they strengthen the artery walls like no other food. Any snack bar that can deliver natural blueberries with no sodium, sugar or chemicals and still taste good, like this Pure Bar, rates 5 stars with me!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I tried the Pure Cherry Cashew Bar and found the taste to be all right.  A 1.7oz (48 gram) serving (one bar) contains 190 calories (70 calories from fat), 3 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and 17 grams of natural fruit sugars.  It is all organic, vegan friendly, has no cholesterol or wheat, and has nothing cooked.  The bars are wrapped in what appears to be Mylar and has a shelf life of over one year.As for the taste, the bar tastes like a semi-sweet fruitcake and the taste and consistency reminded me of the cherry nut cakes that came in MREs back in the 80s and 90s but with much less calories and fat.  190 calories seems a little much to me for all organic and no added sugar but I think the bar contained the right amount of fruit and nuts to have a decent taste so it was probably a good tradeoff against the number of calories.  Warning - it does contain cashews and walnuts for those with allergies.It seems like a decent product but I found it to be nothing special.  However, it you have special dietary needs or prefer organic, the Pure Cherry Cashew Bar would probably appeal to you.',\n",

Some of these \"marketing schemes\" are, but not limited to, food being \"light\", \"fat free\", \"100 calorie serving\", \"low carb\", \"sugar free\" and in this case \"organic\".  I must admit, I like to be very aware about what kind of food I am eating.  Cognizance and cuisine should be a given when making a wise choice about not only eating food, but what type of food.This is an organic raw fruit and nut bar by Pure, the flavor is \"cherry cashew\".  The first thing I noticed when I opened the wrapper is the bar isn\\'t very appetizing.  It looks like a small burnt fruit cake that was moist.  As for the taste, I found it to be very tart.  There is also this very acerbic aftertaste.  As for the texture, it was chewy and I felt like I had powder in my mouth. I realize this is a \"raw\" and \"organic\" fruit bar, but come on.  If that wasn\\'t enough, this bar is 190 calories and 8 grams of total fat, this fruit bar is small.  I suppose in this case organic doesn\\'t equal \"figure friendly\" or \"low in fat\".Overall, I didn\\'t even finish the bar.  I ate maybe half of it.  I can appreciate what Pure is doing by making and marketing an organic fruit bar; in contrast, when eating food taste is still paramount.  I also think that unneeded calories and high fat content shouldn\\'t be disguised as \"organic\".  Which leads me to believe how \"organic\" is this food product...?',\n",

(Note:  for those whom the following may affect, there is a warning that the \"product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, tree nuts\".)  Furthermore, the label states it contains a full daily serving of fruit, is rich in omega-3s, is vegan & certified organic.The taste is very cherry & nutty, with a bit of a bread-like back flavor, if you will, no doubt from the rice protein concentrate.  It is pleasantly sweet as well, due to the cherries & agave nectar.  In fact, I find the sweetness just right for my tastes, but I do not care for overly sweet foods in general.The texture is not disagreeable like some other \"health\" bars I\\'ve tried - not too gooey, but it stays together well & doesn\\'t crumble apart when you bite into it.  It is nice and chewy, but not overly so.It is somewhat high in calories at 190 per serving (one 1.7 ounce bar), and contains 8 grams total of fat (0.5 grams of saturated fat), 0 grams of cholesterol, only 5 milligrams of sodium, 7 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber & 17 grams of sugars (natural fruit sugars).  But, the natural sugars & protein would make it a good bar to have in my bicycle bag for a quick energy snack while riding.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised by this bar.  In the interset of full disclosure, I am a middle-aged male who is far from a \"health food nut\" - in fact, I like a steak or a cheeseburger as much as the next guy!

       "  'reviewText': 'Any sort of snack bar that is marketed as being either organic or a more healthy alternative to candy bars are usually going to be a hit or miss affair, with most failing in the taste department.  The \"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry\" bar isn\\'t a total miss, but it doesn\\'t exactly hit a home run either.There is a significant amount of fat and sugar in the bar, but it\\'s all coming from fruit sugar and raw nuts, which automatically makes it a better choice than anything that has high fructose corn syrup as the first ingredient.  The bar also has small amounts of calcium and vitamin C, but significantly less of the vitamins and minerals typically found in health bars.  On the upside, absolutely everything is organic and nothing is cooked, so it has a huge appeal to anyone who prefers non-processed foods.As far as the taste is concerned it\\'s definitely not a candy bar or any other snack with loads of extra sugar.  It has a very mild blueberry flavor, which is pleasant, but not outstanding.  The texture is a winner however, as its incredibly chewy and moist.  Overall it seems like the flavor should be better for something that\\'s so packed with fruits and nuts. Aside from the flavor and nutrition aspects, the Pure bar does have another draw for environmentally conscious consumers.  Pure runs a campaign where they plant a tree for every three wrappers sent in to their headquarters, which may make them worth buying even if the flavor isn\\'t amazing.While the blueberry taste is toned down and the bar doesn\\'t offer as much extra nutritional value as the standard health food bar, it\\'s still worth a try for anyone who wants to see if they dig the texture or just wants to support an environmentally friendly product.',\n",

They taste very similar with one tasting somewhat of cherry and the other of blueberry.  Both are good.  I guess that's amazing for something that claims to have no sodium.

My first reaction to the cherry cashew was \"this tastes like \\'health food\\'\"--maybe a good thing to some, but admittedly, I\\'ve got a sweet tooth and found the earthy taste rather bland. The cherries do add a tangy kick, but I would have preferred it to balance the tanginess with more sweetness. The texture is chewy and somewhat grainy, with a bit of nutty crunch. What the cherry cashew bar lacks in taste it makes up somewhat in its hearty, satisfying quality. It\\'s organic, vegan, gluten free, and all-natural, making it a healthy snack. It\\'s a great energy pick-me-up, rich in protein (7g), fiber (3g), and a variety of vitamins and minerals (though not incredibly large amounts of these--it\\'s no true substitute for fresh fruit).

       "  'reviewText': 'When I want a snack, I don\\'t care if it\\'s good for me. I just want it to taste good. I tried this bar because I like cherries, and I like nuts. I figured we were off to a pretty good start right there. I was wrong.The number one ingredient on the lable turned out to be dates. Dates? Yep. Dates. Apparently the dates and some rice protien makes up the soft-cookie-like, chewy base. I shared the bar with a friend, and I thought the base was mostly flavorless, but she thought it tasted like prunes.While the label says \"cashew\", there are also walnuts and almonds in the bar. I thought the walnut taste overwhelmed the cashew taste, but that could be because I\\'m sensitive to walnuts. My throat tingled for an hour after eating the bar. Someone with a more severe walnut allergy might have great issue with a cashew bar that has walnuts in it.The cherries were tart, but there were so few in the bar that it was possible to take a bite and not get any cherries. Perhaps they should have infused the date/rice protien base with some cherry juice to get some more flavor in the bar.I suppose if you\\'re used to eating flavorless things like rice cakes and unsalted granolla this might be a nice bar for a snack. But if you eat like a normal person, this bar is just something to gnaw on. It\\'s not a very satisfying snack at all.As I swallow, I\\'m reminded to recount one important point I learned trying this bar: Absolutely stay away from it if you\\'re allergic to walnuts.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I tried this Pure Bar, and I liked it. I am comforted by the ingredients: lots of protein, and both vitamins and minerals. My doctors want me to have more protein and fiber and less sodium and cholesterol.  \"Pure Bar\" fits the doctor\\'s orders.\"The Pure Bar Organic Blueberry\"  has six grams of protein, and twenty-six grams of carbohydrate with 3 grams of fiber.  It also has 19 grams of natural fruit sugars, eight grams of fat, but has only 190 calories.  It is also gluten free and contains zero sodium.Since the label mentions \"organic dates, organic rice protein concentrate, and apple juice and lemon juice as well as blueberry, it is tough to decide on a name for the \"taste\"  The taste is not great. It is a bit fruity but not distinctly blueberry.Prue Organic Wild Blueberry bar is much better for my health than most other snack and energy bar that I have seen on the market. It doesn\\'t takes as good as a candy bar or an ice cream sunday, but it is much better for me. I highly recommend Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar for anyone interested in a healthy snack bar.',\n",

They are gluten free with no preservatives, but the bar I had had an expiration date 9 months from the time I received it, so that is a pretty good shelf life for a natural no preservative food.Two of us in the household tasted the bar and thought it was tasty and fruity, it is chewy and soft. It has a cherry taste, but the main taste are the dates, the nuts seem to be ground very fine. It does have a high price in my opinion for a 1.7 oz snack, but natural foods seem to have a higher price than the every day snack items. So if it serves your needs and wants as a natural- gluten free - preservative free - 190 calorie snack it would be perfect for you.',\n",

This bar is mostly mashed up dates gluing together a collection of fruits, nuts and oats. They aren\\'t bad, but nor are they particularly wonderful.  They are pretty much standard issue for this type of snack.The bars are super dense, not as chewy as a Powerbar, but still give your teeth a workout biting off a chunk.  I had the opportunity to try the Wild Blueberry bar as well, and with both bars it is difficult to distinguish the featured flavor.I passed a few pieces of this \"Cherry Cashew\" bar around to some friends in a blind taste test, and none of them was able to guess that the intended flavor was cherry.  The overwhelming response was \"dates\" along with \"fruitcake.\"  Honestly, after eating both the blueberry and the cherry, there wasn\\'t a considerable difference in flavor.Which isn\\'t so bad.  I happen to like fruitcake, and so the bar was good enough that I was happy to eat it.  If you are looking for a healthy snack, this is probably as good as the rest. I thought it was tasty, and would eat them if available. But it is nothing amazing.',\n",
